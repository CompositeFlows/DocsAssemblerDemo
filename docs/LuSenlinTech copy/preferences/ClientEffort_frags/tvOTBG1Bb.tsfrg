###### Key Features: 

- Core Automation - same robotics and app-integrated sensors as Low-Effort tier.
- Customizable kits (e.g., manual-override water pumps, build-your-own LED arrays, and open-source AI firmware)
- Add-ons like bio-printers for seeds or genetic scanners for hybrids.
- Effort-scaling modes let you dial automation up or down.
- Community Hub - share recipes and trade produce with neighbors.
- Time Needed **2–5 hrs / week** (or as deep as you want)

###### Service Model: 

- Flat-pack frames, 4D-printed plumbing, open firmware.
- Sensor Suite - nitrate, ORP, VOC, spore, CO₂ — all exposed via API.
- Bio-Bank Access - Seed & brood-stock library; CRISPR-ready lines (where legal).
- Training & Cert - On-site or VR workshops; “Balcony Agronomist” certificate path.
- Beta Privileges - Early hardware drops at cost; community marketplace for mods.
- Initial kits via courier, plus bulk supplies and access to our "Innovation Hub" (tutorials, 3D-printable parts, peer challenges). 
- Quarterly upgrade swaps for new prototypes.
