Because culinary herbs are typically harvested in small, high-flavour portions, the Herb 〈¦‹modelName›¦〉 Module is subdivided into 〈¦‹bayCount›¦〉 bays. Plant one herb across all bays for bulk harvests or mix up to 8 different herbs for a living spice rack.

All herbs are bred for:

- ≤ 25cm mature height.

- Fast regrowth after cutting.

- High essential-oil concentration for maximum aroma in small harvests.
