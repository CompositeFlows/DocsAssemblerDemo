###### AquaGreen Technologies
  
- **Shallow Raceway with Swirl-Flow Control** – flat 3 L tray whose paddle wheel shifts from laminar flow (duckweed) to vortex (spirulina) on demand.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Harvest Mesh Roller** – fine nylon belt lifts floating biomass, compresses it into tidy discs and returns excess water.
- **Auto-Remineraliser** – ion-selective sensors trigger micro-doses of chelated nutrients after harvest, resetting solution chemistry.  

###### Modules
- Solo
- Twin
