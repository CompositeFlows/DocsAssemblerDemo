###### CrustaBay Technologies  

- **Biofloc Culture Tank** – dense microbial soup converts shrimp waste into edible floc, cutting feed costs 30% and nearly eliminating water exchange.
- **Rotating Drum Filter** – mesh drum continuously strains solids; a backwash jet cleans the screen automatically into a compost stream.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Water Jacket** – liquid jacket regulates aquaculture temperature within ±0.2 °C via solid-state Peltier plates.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Robotic Dip-Net** – articulated scoop sizes shrimp, nets only mature ones and transfers them to an ice-cooled side pocket.

###### Modules
