###### Technologies
  
- **Micro-Bead Capillary Substrate** – 1 mm porous glass beads wick moisture yet drain instantly; a five-minute steam pulse sterilises them between crops.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **AI Fruit-Colour Tracking** – vision model monitors hue shift; when 95% of surface reaches target colour, the system alerts or triggers the snip-bot.
- **Magnetic Snip-Bot** – miniature arm rides magnetic rails, snips ripe fruit and drops it into a sealed cup - hands stay clean.
