## Aromatic Herb — Tower Editions

Because culinary herbs are typically harvested in small, high-flavour portions, the Herb Solo Module is subdivided into 8 bays. Plant one herb across all bays for bulk harvests or mix up to 8 different herbs for a living spice rack.

All herbs are bred for:
- ≤ 25cm mature height.
- Fast regrowth after cutting.
- High essential-oil concentration for maximum aroma in small harvests.
