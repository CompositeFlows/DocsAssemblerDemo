###### LeafLift Technologies  

- **Deep-Flow NFT Trough Inserts** – interchangeable gullies that hold a shallow, fast-moving nutrient film, ensuring constant oxygen and preventing salt crusting on greens.
- **Variable-Speed Laminar Pump** – EC-sensor-driven pump that throttles to 30% at night, saving ~0.6 kWh day⁻¹ while preserving dissolved-oxygen levels.
- **PureLight™ Clamshell Dome** – double-wall aerogel lid with 95% light transmission yet 0.002 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ insulation, keeping canopy temperature stable in unheated rooms.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Cut-and-Come-Again Optical Mapping** – multispectral camera highlights leaves safe to cut while leaving meristems intact, extending harvest to 60 + days.
