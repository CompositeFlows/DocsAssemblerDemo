###### GasterPod Technologies  

- **Track Maze Habitat** – 90 mm spiral raceway forces snails to exercise, yielding thicker shells and higher meat-to-viscera ratios.
- **Bio-Film Drip-Feed System** – dripper coats feed leaves with probiotic film rich in calcium, feeding snails and suppressing pathogens simultaneously.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **AI-Scheduled 7-Day Purging** – algorithm times snail fasting so digestive tracts clear exactly on the user’s chosen cooking date.

###### Modules
- Twin
