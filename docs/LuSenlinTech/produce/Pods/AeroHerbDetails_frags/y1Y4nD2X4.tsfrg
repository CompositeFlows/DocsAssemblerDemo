###### Technologies  
  
- **PureLight™** - transmits 95% of light of glass whilst providing superior insulation (~0.002–0.005 W/m·K). It is lightweight, durable, maximizes photosynthesis by maintaining stable temperatures for year-round crop growth.
- **HydraRail™ Fluid Manifold** - micro-drip, fog, or flood modes selectable per Frame; self-sealing/healing NanoHealShield™ couplers prevent spills. Change crops or switch to aquaponics on the fly.
- **HydraPad™** - a smart hydroponic insert that uses a bio-engineered nanofiber matrix and quantum sensors to optimize aquatic plant growth and enable 95% nutrient recycling, with a SlideLock™ mechanism for 10-second swaps.
- **HydraRail™ Fog Nozzles** – quick-connect misters that plug into the frame's magnetic fluid bus; software toggles each port between fog, drip or off without hardware swaps.
- **NanoSunBeam™** Organic-phosphor LEDs auto-tune PAR, far-red & UV-A. Better flavour, longer shelf life, lower kWh.
- **RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges** – single-use seed mats embedded with passive RFID chips. HarvestSage™ reads variety, sow-date and recipe, then logs the full life-cycle for traceability.
- **Deep-Flow NFT Trough Inserts** – interchangeable gullies that hold a shallow, fast-moving nutrient film, ensuring constant oxygen and preventing salt crusting on greens.
- **Variable-Speed Laminar Pump** – EC-sensor-driven pump that throttles to 30% at night, saving ~0.6 kWh day⁻¹ while preserving dissolved-oxygen levels.
- **Laminar Airflow Canopy** – silent cross-flow fan creates a 0.2 m s⁻¹ air sheet, dispersing humidity pockets and reducing petal disease.
- **PrecisionHeat™**  - Graphene Heat-Film, printed onto root chamber walls for ±0.3°C control.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Root-Film** – graphene heater layer fused to root-chamber walls; PID control holds ±0.3 °C, boosting germination and slashing energy when inactive zones power down.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.
- **Micro-Bead Capillary Substrate** – 1 mm porous glass beads wick moisture yet drain instantly; a five-minute steam pulse sterilises them between crops.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Cut-and-Come-Again Optical Mapping** – multispectral camera highlights leaves safe to cut while leaving meristems intact, extending harvest to 60 + days.  
- **Harvest-Ready Green Door Light** – handle glows green when biomass, size or aroma sensors confirm peak quality.  
- **Auto-Lift Carousel** – motorised ring rotates mature bay to waist height, making harvest a single ergonomic pull.
