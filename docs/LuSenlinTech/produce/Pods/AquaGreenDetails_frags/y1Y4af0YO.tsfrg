##### How It Works

###### 1. The Live Culture Inoculant
Lǜ Sēnlín’s nursery supplies live, active cultures for each aquatic species - from **Duckweed Protein Blend** to **Spirulina Mat ‘BlueCore’**. This selection is ideal because these species thrive in nutrient-rich water, with some floating on the surface and others suspended in the water column, creating a multi-layered production system within a single, compact unit.

###### 2. Hydrodynamic Cultivation in the Module
Once the culture is introduced to the AquaGreen raceway, HarvestSage™ initiates a specialized aquatic program:
- The **Shallow Raceway with Swirl-Flow Control** creates either a gentle laminar flow for floating plants like **Azolla ‘Nitro-Fern Nano’** or a concentrated vortex for mixing **Spirulina** and other micro-algae.
- The **Micro-Bubble Column** maintains dissolved oxygen at ~10 mg L⁻¹, crucial for the health of rooted plants like **Water Spinach ‘Aqua-Morning’** and filter-feeding organisms.
- The **Real-Time Turbidity & pH Sensors** continuously monitor algal density and acidity, prompting automatic corrections to maintain optimal growth conditions.
This hydrodynamic precision allows each species to be grown in its ideal fluid environment, maximizing growth rates and nutritional quality.

###### 3. The Continuous Aquatic Harvest
The AquaGreen module operates on a continuous production cycle.
- For surface plants like **Duckweed** and **Frogbit**, the **Harvest Mesh Roller** automatically skims, compresses, and de-waters the biomass into tidy discs.
- For macro-algae like **Red Ogo ‘Metro-Ogo’** and rooted plants, manual harvesting is simple and clean.
- After each harvest, the **Auto-Remineraliser** instantly replenishes chelated nutrients, resetting the water chemistry for the next growth cycle.
- The system provides a **continuous yield of 80–150g of fresh aquatic biomass per day, depending on species and light conditions.**
