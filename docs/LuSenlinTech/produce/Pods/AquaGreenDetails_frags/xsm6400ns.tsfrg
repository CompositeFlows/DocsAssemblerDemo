#### Swirl-Flow Aquatic Biome

This module is a compact 3-litre raceway system that cultivates all 12 varieties of aquatic plants and algae from our Balcony Edition catalogue. It uses adjustable hydraulic currents to support everything from floating duckweed to dense spirulina, while automated systems handle harvesting and nutrient renewal.

##### How It Works

###### 1. The Live Culture Inoculant
Lǜ Sēnlín’s nursery supplies live, active cultures for each aquatic species—from **Duckweed Protein Blend** to **Spirulina Mat ‘BlueCore’**. This selection is ideal because these species thrive in nutrient-rich water, with some floating on the surface and others suspended in the water column, creating a multi-layered production system within a single, compact unit.

###### 2. Hydrodynamic Cultivation in the Module
Once the culture is introduced to the AquaGreen raceway, HarvestSage™ initiates a specialized aquatic program:
- The ****Shallow Raceway with Swirl-Flow Control** – flat 3 L tray whose paddle wheel shifts from laminar flow (duckweed) to vortex (spirulina) on demand.** creates either a gentle laminar flow for floating plants like **Azolla ‘Nitro-Fern Nano’** or a concentrated vortex for mixing **Spirulina** and other micro-algae.
- The ****Micro-Bubble Column** – ceramic diffuser creates < 100 µm bubbles, pushing dissolved O₂ to ~10 mg L⁻¹ - ideal for bivalve filter-feeding.** maintains dissolved oxygen at ~10 mg L⁻¹, crucial for the health of rooted plants like **Water Spinach ‘Aqua-Morning’** and filter-feeding organisms.
- The ****Real-Time Turbidity & pH Sensors** – optical and electrochemical probes guard water clarity and acidity, prompting automatic corrections.** continuously monitor algal density and acidity, prompting automatic corrections to maintain optimal growth conditions.
This hydrodynamic precision allows each species to be grown in its ideal fluid environment, maximizing growth rates and nutritional quality.

###### 3. The Continuous Aquatic Harvest
The AquaGreen module operates on a continuous production cycle.
- For surface plants like **Duckweed** and **Frogbit**, the ****Harvest Mesh Roller** – fine nylon belt lifts floating biomass, compresses it into tidy discs and returns excess water.** automatically skims, compresses, and de-waters the biomass into tidy discs.
- For macro-algae like **Red Ogo ‘Metro-Ogo’** and rooted plants, manual harvesting is simple and clean.
- After each harvest, the ****Auto-Remineraliser** – ion-selective sensors trigger micro-doses of chelated nutrients after harvest, resetting solution chemistry.** instantly replenishes chelated nutrients, resetting the water chemistry for the next growth cycle.
- The system provides a **continuous yield of 80–150g of fresh aquatic biomass per day, depending on species and light conditions.**

##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- The use of controlled hydrodynamics to optimize growth conditions for different aquatic species has been proven in large-scale aquaculture and is now miniaturized for home use.
- Different flow regimes (laminar vs. turbulent) directly affect nutrient uptake and photosynthesis rates in aquatic plants and algae, a principle this system leverages precisely.
- Automated nutrient balancing and harvesting make continuous cultivation possible, transforming what is typically an open-pond process into a controlled, countertop-scale operation.

In short, the AquaGreen is a **miniaturized aquatic farm** that uses precision hydrodynamics and automated chemistry management to turn a compact space into a prolific source of nutrient-dense aquatic plants and algae, from staple proteins to gourmet sea vegetables.

###### AquaGreen Technologies
  
- **PureLight™** - transmits 95% of light of glass whilst providing superior insulation (~0.002–0.005 W/m·K). It is lightweight, durable, maximizes photosynthesis by maintaining stable temperatures for year-round crop growth.
- **Shallow Raceway with Swirl-Flow Control** – flat 3 L tray whose paddle wheel shifts from laminar flow (duckweed) to vortex (spirulina) on demand.
- **SolisCell™** - a compact, high-density aquaculture system that uses biofloc technology to convert fish waste into edible protein, reducing feed needs by 70%. Its AI-optimized filtration and pathogen-trapping nano-filters enable high stocking densities and 99% water recirculation for sustainable urban farming.
- **Micro-Bubble Column** – ceramic diffuser creates < 100 µm bubbles, pushing dissolved O₂ to ~10 mg L⁻¹ - ideal for bivalve filter-feeding.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.
- **Real-Time Turbidity & pH Sensors** – optical and electrochemical probes guard water clarity and acidity, prompting automatic corrections.
- **Rotating Drum Filter** – mesh drum continuously strains solids; a backwash jet cleans the screen automatically into a compost stream.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Water Jacket** – liquid jacket regulates aquaculture temperature within ±0.2 °C via solid-state Peltier plates.
- **NanoSunBeam™** Organic-phosphor LEDs auto-tune PAR, far-red & UV-A. Better flavour, longer shelf life, lower kWh.
- **Deep-Flow NFT Trough Inserts** – interchangeable gullies that hold a shallow, fast-moving nutrient film, ensuring constant oxygen and preventing salt crusting on greens.
- **HydraPad™** - a smart hydroponic insert that uses a bio-engineered nanofiber matrix and quantum sensors to optimize aquatic plant growth and enable 95% nutrient recycling, with a SlideLock™ mechanism for 10-second swaps.
- **Auto-Remineraliser** – ion-selective sensors trigger micro-doses of chelated nutrients after harvest, resetting solution chemistry.
- **Protein Skimmer + UV-C Loop** – foam-fractionator strips dissolved organics while an inline UV-C tube neutralises free-floating pathogens.
