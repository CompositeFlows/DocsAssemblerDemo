#### Forest-Floor Fruiting Chamber

This module is a dark-cycle, climate-controlled system specifically engineered for all 15 strains of gourmet and functional fungi in our Balcony Edition catalogue. It replicates the precise environmental triggers of a natural forest floor to rapidly fruit a diverse array of mushrooms, from delicate enoki to robust lion's mane.

##### How It Works

###### 1. The Pre-Colonised Block
Lǜ Sēnlín’s laboratory supplies fully colonised substrate blocks, where the mycelium has completely permeated the nutrient-rich medium. This selection—from the fast-fruiting **Oyster ‘Pearl-Fog’** to the potent **Reishi ‘Micro-Lingzhi’**—is ideal because each strain's specific fruiting triggers (temperature drops, O₂ spikes) can be perfectly executed within the sealed, programmable environment.

###### 2. Controlled Fruiting in the Module
Once the block is inserted into the MycoNest, HarvestSage™ initiates a species-specific fruiting program:
- The ****Dark-Cycle Chamber with O₂ Pulse** – lights stay off; dissolved O₂ spikes hourly, replicating dawn forest cues that trigger mushroom pinning.** system maintains complete darkness while releasing hourly pulses of oxygen, replicating the dawn forest cues that trigger mushroom pinning (the formation of tiny mushrooms).
- A ****CO₂-Scrubbing Bio-Filter** – living moss/activated-carbon mat absorbs excess CO₂ during colonisation, preventing off-flavours and speeding fruit-set.** first maintains high CO₂ levels during the final stage of colonization, then scrubs it from the air to initiate the fruiting stage, preventing misshapen fruits and speeding up development.
- High humidity (90-95% RH) is constantly maintained to ensure tender, plump mushrooms without drying out.

###### 3. The Rapid-Cycle Harvest
The MycoNest is designed for fast, clean, and continuous harvests.
- When mushrooms reach peak size and before spore release, the entire block is accessed.
- The ****Pop-Out Grow-Block Sleeve** – mushroom substrate slides out in a rigid case; swap takes < 5 s with zero crumble.** allows the spent substrate to be slid out and a new, pre-colonised block to be swapped in under 5 seconds, with zero mess or crumbling.
- After harvest, the ****Sterile UV-C Pulse** – five-second 265 nm flash disinfects the empty bay before a new seed pad slides in.** automatically disinfects the empty chamber, preventing cross-contamination between cycles.
- The system provides a **rapid yield, producing 200–400g of pristine mushrooms per block over a 7-14 day fruiting cycle.**

##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Mycology research has precisely identified the environmental shifts—specifically a drop in CO₂ and a spike in humidity and oxygen—that signal to the mycelium that it is time to produce fruiting bodies to spread its spores.
- Contamination is the primary challenge in mushroom cultivation; the combination of pre-sterilised blocks and in-situ UV-C sterilisation creates a clean-room environment that eliminates competitors.
- The separation of the colonization phase (done off-site in a lab) from the fruiting phase (in the module) drastically simplifies the process for the user and guarantees success.

In short, the MycoNest is a **myco-precise fruiting environment** that uses atmospheric science and sterile technique to reliably transform compact blocks into abundant, clean harvests of gourmet and functional mushrooms.

###### MycoNest Technologies  

- **Dark-Cycle Chamber with O₂ Pulse** – lights stay off; dissolved O₂ spikes hourly, replicating dawn forest cues that trigger mushroom pinning.
- **CO₂-Scrubbing Bio-Filter** – living moss/activated-carbon mat absorbs excess CO₂ during colonisation, preventing off-flavours and speeding fruit-set.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.
- **Sterile UV-C Pulse** – five-second 265 nm flash disinfects the empty bay before a new seed pad slides in.
- **PrecisionHeat™**  - Graphene Heat-Film, printed onto root chamber walls for ±0.3°C control.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Water Jacket** – liquid jacket regulates aquaculture temperature within ±0.2 °C via solid-state Peltier plates.
- **HydraRail™ Fog Nozzles** – quick-connect misters that plug into the frame’s magnetic fluid bus; software toggles each port between fog, drip or off without hardware swaps.
- **Laminar Airflow Canopy** – silent cross-flow fan creates a 0.2 m s⁻¹ air sheet, dispersing humidity pockets and reducing petal disease.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Pop-Out Grow-Block Sleeve** – mushroom substrate slides out in a rigid case; swap takes < 5 s with zero crumble.
- **Dehydration Mode** – chamber warms to 40 °C with 30% RH airflow, producing shelf-stable dried mushrooms.
