#### Morphing Aquatic Habitat

This module is a 40-litre oval recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) that cultivates all 10 varieties of edible fish from our Balcony Edition catalogue. Its programmable flow dynamics can replicate specific aquatic habitats, from a gentle koi pond to a swift trout stream, providing the ideal environment for each species' health and growth.

##### How It Works

###### 1. The Fingerling Stock
Lǜ Sēnlín’s hatchery supplies juvenile fish (fingerlings), carefully acclimated to closed-system life. This diverse selection—from the tranquil **Herbivore Goldfish ‘FoodFin’** to the current-loving **Dwarf Rainbow Trout ‘CoolStream’**—is ideal because the system's morphing nature can be perfectly tailored to the specific behavioural and physiological needs of each species.

###### 2. Hydro-Adaptive Cultivation in the Module
Once the fingerlings are introduced to the FinWave tank, HarvestSage™ initiates a species-specific program:
- The ****Laminar-Flow Oval Tank** – 40 L oval vessel with variable impellers that mimic anything from koi-pond ripples to trout-stream currents.** uses its variable impellers to create anything from gentle koi-pond ripples for **Nano Carp ‘Silver Byte’** to strong trout-stream currents for exercise and oxygenation.
- The ****Moving-Bed Nitrification Cartridge** – floating bio-media tumble in an aerated chamber, converting ammonia to nitrate and stabilising water quality.** ensures water quality, with floating bio-media tumbling in an aerated chamber to convert toxic ammonia into nitrate.
- For cold-water species like **Dwarf Rainbow Trout ‘CoolStream’**, the ****Thermoelectric Plate Chiller** – solid-state cooler that drops tank temperature to 12 °C for cold-water trout without external chillers.** actively lowers and maintains the water temperature to a chilly 12°C.
This hydro-adaptive approach minimizes stress by providing a familiar environment, which is fundamental to achieving healthy growth rates and superior flesh quality in a compact system.

###### 3. The Selective Harvest
The FinWave is designed for flexible harvesting that suits your needs.
- Using ****App-Selectable Harvest Modes** – mobile app toggles FinWave between bulk harvest, staggered take or ornamental display.**, you can choose a bulk harvest or a staggered "catch-your-dinner" approach.
- The ****Smart Net Guide** – retractable gate herds fish into a front catch pocket for stress-free capture.** gently herds selected fish into a front catch pocket for a low-stress capture, preserving the quality of the remaining stock.
- The system provides a **yield of 1–1.5 kg of fresh, high-quality fish per full production cycle.**

##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- The morphology of aquaculture tanks and the flow dynamics within them have a profound impact on fish welfare, affecting stress levels, muscle development, and waste dispersion.
- Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) represent the pinnacle of sustainable fish farming, recycling over 99% of the water by using mechanical and biological filtration; this system brings that technology to a domestic scale.
- By allowing the environment to be programmed for specific species, the system acknowledges that one habitat does not fit all, optimizing welfare and yield simultaneously.

In short, the FinWave is a **programmable aquatic habitat** that uses advanced hydrodynamics and closed-loop science to provide a pristine, species-specific environment, turning a compact tank into a reliable source of the freshest, healthiest fish.

###### FinWave Technologies  

- **SolisCell™** - a compact, high-density aquaculture system that uses biofloc technology to convert fish waste into edible protein, reducing feed needs by 70%. Its AI-optimized filtration and pathogen-trapping nano-filters enable high stocking densities and 99% water recirculation for sustainable urban farming.
- **Rotating Drum Filter** – mesh drum continuously strains solids; a backwash jet cleans the screen automatically into a compost stream.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Water Jacket** – liquid jacket regulates aquaculture temperature within ±0.2 °C via solid-state Peltier plates.
- **Real-Time Turbidity & pH Sensors** – optical and electrochemical probes guard water clarity and acidity, prompting automatic corrections.
- **Micro-Bubble Column** – ceramic diffuser creates < 100 µm bubbles, pushing dissolved O₂ to ~10 mg L⁻¹ - ideal for bivalve filter-feeding.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.
- **Rotating Drum Filter** – mesh drum continuously strains solids; a backwash jet cleans the screen automatically into a compost stream.
- **Protein Skimmer + UV-C Loop** – foam-fractionator strips dissolved organics while an inline UV-C tube neutralises free-floating pathogens.
- **Moving-Bed Nitrification Cartridge** – floating bio-media tumble in an aerated chamber, converting ammonia to nitrate and stabilising water quality.
- **Laminar-Flow Oval Tank** – 40 L oval vessel with variable impellers that mimic anything from koi-pond ripples to trout-stream currents.
- **Thermoelectric Plate Chiller** – solid-state cooler that drops tank temperature to 12 °C for cold-water trout without external chillers.
- **In-Situ Insect-Larvae Feeder** – hopper breeds black soldier fly larvae from kitchen scraps; doses live grubs for high-protein, zero-cost feed.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Robotic Dip-Net** – articulated scoop sizes shrimp, nets only mature ones and transfers them to an ice-cooled side pocket.
- **Auto-Chill to 4 °C** – thermoelectric chiller drops mollusc temperature two hours pre-harvest, inducing dormancy.
- **App-Selectable Harvest Modes** – mobile app toggles FinWave between bulk harvest, staggered take or ornamental display.
- **Smart Net Guide** – retractable gate herds fish into a front catch pocket for stress-free capture.
