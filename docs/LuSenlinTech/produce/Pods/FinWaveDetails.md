#### Morphing Aquatic Habitat

This module is a 40-litre oval recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) that cultivates all 10 varieties of edible fish from our Balcony Edition catalogue. Its programmable flow dynamics can replicate specific aquatic habitats, from a gentle koi pond to a swift trout stream, providing the ideal environment for each species' health and growth.
