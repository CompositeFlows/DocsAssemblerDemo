##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- NASA-developed NFT principles are perfected for home use, creating a perfectly balanced system where water, nutrients, and oxygen are delivered with minimal waste and maximum efficiency.
- The combination of a highly oxygenated root zone and the optimal light transmission of PureLightâ„¢ triggers rapid photosynthetic growth without the stress factors present in soil agriculture.
- By removing the soil variable entirely, the system eliminates weeds, minimizes pests, and delivers precisely what the plant needs, exactly when it needs it.

In short, the LeafLift is a **high-density, continuous-harvest hydroponic system** that turns a compact space into a personal, year-round salad garden, producing the cleanest and most flavourful greens imaginable.
