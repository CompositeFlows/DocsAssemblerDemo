###### MycoNest Technologies  

- **Dark-Cycle Chamber with O₂ Pulse** – lights stay off; dissolved O₂ spikes hourly, replicating dawn forest cues that trigger mushroom pinning.
- **CO₂-Scrubbing Bio-Filter** – living moss/activated-carbon mat absorbs excess CO₂ during colonisation, preventing off-flavours and speeding fruit-set.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Pop-Out Grow-Block Sleeve** – mushroom substrate slides out in a rigid case; swap takes < 5 s with zero crumble.
- **Dehydration Mode** – chamber warms to 40 °C with 30% RH airflow, producing shelf-stable dried mushrooms.  

###### Modules
- Solo
- Twin
