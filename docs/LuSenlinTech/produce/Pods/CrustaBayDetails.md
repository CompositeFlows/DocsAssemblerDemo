#### Biofloc Crustacean Nursery

This module is an 18-litre, high-density recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) that cultivates all 10 varieties of dwarf crustaceans from our Balcony Edition catalogue. It employs advanced biofloc technology to create a self-cleaning ecosystem, producing fresh shrimp or crayfish with near-zero water exchange.

##### How It Works

###### 1. The Post-Larval Inoculant
Lǜ Sēnlín’s hatchery supplies post-larval shrimp or juvenile crayfish, carefully graded for size and health. This selection—from **Freshwater Prawn ‘Pearl-King’** to **Mini Crayfish ‘Green-Marble’**—is ideal because these species thrive in the microbial-rich environment of a biofloc system, converting what would be waste into valuable nutrition.

###### 2. Symbiotic Cultivation in the Module
Once the crustaceans are introduced to the CrustaBay tank, HarvestSage™ initiates a specialized aquaculture program:
- The **BioFlocLite™** system maintains a dense soup of beneficial microbes that continuously convert ammonia from waste into edible microbial protein, reducing feed requirements by up to 30%.
- The ****Rotating Drum Filter** – mesh drum continuously strains solids; a backwash jet cleans the screen automatically into a compost stream.** automatically and continuously strains solid wastes, maintaining water clarity and preventing the accumulation of toxic compounds.
- The ****PrecisionHeat™ Water Jacket** – liquid jacket regulates aquaculture temperature within ±0.2 °C via solid-state Peltier plates.** maintains a stable tropical temperature (±0.2°C), which is crucial for proper molting, growth, and survival of all species, particularly the **Dwarf Redclaw Crayfish ‘Crimson Pinch’**.
This creates a stable, balanced ecosystem where waste is continuously processed, and the crustaceans have access to a constant, natural food source between feedings.

###### 3. The Selective Harvest
The CrustaBay is managed for sustainable, continuous harvests.
- Using ****App-Selectable Harvest Modes** – mobile app toggles FinWave between bulk harvest, staggered take or ornamental display.**, you can choose to harvest a few individuals for a meal or perform a larger, staggered harvest.
- The ****Robotic Dip-Net** – articulated scoop sizes shrimp, nets only mature ones and transfers them to an ice-cooled side pocket.** or ****Smart Net Guide** – retractable gate herds fish into a front catch pocket for stress-free capture.** allows for the stress-free selection and removal of mature individuals, like **Urban Koi ‘Quick-Koi’**, without disturbing the entire population.
- The system supports a **steady harvest, yielding 150–200g of fresh crustaceans per month from a single tank.**

##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Biofloc technology (BFT) is a well-established method in commercial aquaculture that enhances water quality and provides a supplemental food source, drastically reducing environmental impact and operational costs.
- The key to success in BFT is maintaining a precise carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, which encourages the growth of heterotrophic bacteria over algae; this is managed automatically by the integrated AI.
- By creating a stable, miniature ecosystem, the module eliminates the need for complex filtration and frequent water changes, making aquaculture accessible and practical in a urban setting.

In short, the CrustaBay is a **self-sustaining crustacean ecosystem** that uses microbial science and precision environmental control to transform a compact tank into a personal source of the freshest, sustainably-raised shrimp and crayfish.

###### CrustaBay Technologies  

- **SolisCell™** - a compact, high-density aquaculture system that uses biofloc technology to convert fish waste into edible protein, reducing feed needs by 70%. Its AI-optimized filtration and pathogen-trapping nano-filters enable high stocking densities and 99% water recirculation for sustainable urban farming.
- **Rotating Drum Filter** – mesh drum continuously strains solids; a backwash jet cleans the screen automatically into a compost stream.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Water Jacket** – liquid jacket regulates aquaculture temperature within ±0.2 °C via solid-state Peltier plates.
- **Real-Time Turbidity & pH Sensors** – optical and electrochemical probes guard water clarity and acidity, prompting automatic corrections.
- **Micro-Bubble Column** – ceramic diffuser creates < 100 µm bubbles, pushing dissolved O₂ to ~10 mg L⁻¹ - ideal for bivalve filter-feeding.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.
- **Rotating Drum Filter** – mesh drum continuously strains solids; a backwash jet cleans the screen automatically into a compost stream.
- **Protein Skimmer + UV-C Loop** – foam-fractionator strips dissolved organics while an inline UV-C tube neutralises free-floating pathogens.
- **Moving-Bed Nitrification Cartridge** – floating bio-media tumble in an aerated chamber, converting ammonia to nitrate and stabilising water quality.
- **Laminar-Flow Oval Tank** – 40 L oval vessel with variable impellers that mimic anything from koi-pond ripples to trout-stream currents.
- **Thermoelectric Plate Chiller** – solid-state cooler that drops tank temperature to 12 °C for cold-water trout without external chillers.
- **In-Situ Insect-Larvae Feeder** – hopper breeds black soldier fly larvae from kitchen scraps; doses live grubs for high-protein, zero-cost feed.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Robotic Dip-Net** – articulated scoop sizes shrimp, nets only mature ones and transfers them to an ice-cooled side pocket.
- **Auto-Chill to 4 °C** – thermoelectric chiller drops mollusc temperature two hours pre-harvest, inducing dormancy.
- **App-Selectable Harvest Modes** – mobile app toggles FinWave between bulk harvest, staggered take or ornamental display.
- **Smart Net Guide** – retractable gate herds fish into a front catch pocket for stress-free capture.
