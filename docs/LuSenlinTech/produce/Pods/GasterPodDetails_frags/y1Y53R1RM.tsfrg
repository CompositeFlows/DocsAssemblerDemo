###### Technologies  

- **Track Maze Habitat** – 90 mm spiral raceway forces snails to exercise, yielding thicker shells and higher meat-to-viscera ratios.
- **Bio-Film Drip-Feed System** – dripper coats feed leaves with probiotic film rich in calcium, feeding snails and suppressing pathogens simultaneously.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.
- **CO₂-Scrubbing Bio-Filter** – living moss/activated-carbon mat absorbs excess CO₂ during colonisation, preventing off-flavours and speeding fruit-set.
- **Real-Time Turbidity & pH Sensors** – optical and electrochemical probes guard water clarity and acidity, prompting automatic corrections.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **AI-Scheduled 7-Day Purging** – algorithm times snail fasting so digestive tracts clear exactly on the user's chosen cooking date.
- **Auto-Chill to 4 °C** – thermoelectric chiller drops mollusc temperature two hours pre-harvest, inducing dormancy.
