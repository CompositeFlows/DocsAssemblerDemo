###### RootVault Technologies  

- **Moisture-Gradient Aerated Columns** – root tubes with dry, aerated tops and moist bases, steering tap-roots downward for uniform shape.
- **Side-Eject Drawer** – sliding carriage pulls the entire root column horizontally, avoiding media compaction or tap-root breakage.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Endoscopic Root-Sizer** – 4 mm probe scans root diameter via structured light and illuminates the door handle when target size is reached.
- **Harvest-Ready Green Door Light** – handle glows green when biomass, size or aroma sensors confirm peak quality.  

###### Modules
- Solo
- Twin
