###### AeroHerb Technologies  

- **Low-pressure Aeroponics Tree** – a branching manifold that sprays a fine nutrient mist at < 1 bar, maximising root oxygen while reducing water use by 95% versus drip systems.
- **Hydra-Rail™ Fog Nozzles** – quick-connect misters that plug into the frame’s magnetic fluid bus; software toggles each port between fog, drip or off without hardware swaps.
- **RFID Seed-Pad Bay Cartridges** – single-use seed mats embedded with passive RFID chips. HarvestSage™ reads variety, sow-date and recipe, then logs the full life-cycle for traceability.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Root-Film** – graphene heater layer fused to root-chamber walls; PID control holds ±0.3 °C, boosting germination and slashing energy when inactive zones power down.
- **PureLight™ Clamshell Dome** – double-wall aerogel lid with 95% light transmission yet 0.002 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ insulation, keeping canopy temperature stable in unheated rooms.

###### Harvest Enhancements 
 
- **Auto-Lift Carousel** – motorised ring rotates mature bay to waist height, making harvest a single ergonomic pull.  
- **Sterile UV-C Pulse** – five-second 265 nm flash disinfects the empty bay before a new seed pad slides in.
