##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- The use of controlled hydrodynamics to optimize growth conditions for different aquatic species has been proven in large-scale aquaculture and is now miniaturized for home use.
- Different flow regimes (laminar vs. turbulent) directly affect nutrient uptake and photosynthesis rates in aquatic plants and algae, a principle this system leverages precisely.
- Automated nutrient balancing and harvesting make continuous cultivation possible, transforming what is typically an open-pond process into a controlled, countertop-scale operation.

In short, the AquaGreen is a **miniaturized aquatic farm** that uses precision hydrodynamics and automated chemistry management to turn a compact space into a prolific source of nutrient-dense aquatic plants and algae, from staple proteins to gourmet sea vegetables.
