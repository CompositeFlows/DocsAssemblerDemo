#### Swirl-Flow Aquatic Biome

This module is a compact 3-litre raceway system that cultivates all 12 varieties of aquatic plants and algae from our Balcony Edition catalogue. It uses adjustable hydraulic currents to support everything from floating duckweed to dense spirulina, while automated systems handle harvesting and nutrient renewal.
