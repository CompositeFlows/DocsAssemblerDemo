##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Studies have demonstrated that truffle mycelium can form symbiotic relationships with a wide range of host plants, including herbaceous roots, and will produce fruiting bodies under controlled conditions.
- Advances in micro-controlled pH, moisture, and COâ‚‚ - common in 2035 vertical farming systems - allow us to replicate the calcareous soils and seasonal cues truffles require, but on a countertop scale.

In short, this system is a **dual-crop root cassette** where a selection of gourmet edible roots serves as a living host for truffle fungi, providing a varied vegetable harvest and bite-size black truffles from a single, compact module.
