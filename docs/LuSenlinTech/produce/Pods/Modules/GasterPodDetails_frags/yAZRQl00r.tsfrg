##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Helixiculture (snail farming) has long established that increased activity directly correlates to improved shell strength and meat quality; the maze habitat mechanizes this principle.
- The use of probiotic biofilms is a modern advancement in animal husbandry, promoting gut health and suppressing disease without antibiotics, which is critical in a dense living environment.
- The precise control of the fasting period is a critical food safety and quality step that is difficult to achieve consistently without automated environmental control.

In short, the GasterPod is a **welfare-optimized cultivation system** that uses behavioural enrichment and targeted nutrition to transform a compact space into a reliable source of gourmet, sustainably-raised snails.
