#### Laminar-Flow Leaf Canopy

This module uses a deep-flow Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system to cultivate a diverse selection of gourmet leafy greens - from delicate **Butterhead Lettuce ‘Silk-Butter’** to robust **Nano-Kale ‘BlueFin’** - suspended beneath a crystal-clear PureLight™ canopy that transmits 95% of light while providing superior insulation.
