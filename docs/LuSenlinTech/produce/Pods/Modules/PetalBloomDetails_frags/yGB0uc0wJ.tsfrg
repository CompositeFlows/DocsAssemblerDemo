##### How It Works

###### 1. The Pre-Vegetative Plug
Lǜ Sēnlín’s nursery supplies pre-grown plugs of each variety, carefully selected for their colour purity, flavour profile, and compact habit. This selection - from the vivid **Nasturtium ‘Citrus Wheel’** to the tangy **Sorrel ‘Lemon Arrow’** - is ideal because these high-value crops require protection from environmental stressors like wind, pests, and pollen contamination to maintain their visual and gustatory perfection.

###### 2. Precision Cultivation in the Module
Once the plugs are seated in the PetalBloom, HarvestSage™ initiates a specialized program for aesthetic and flavour optimization:
- The **Laminar Airflow Canopy** creates a gentle, 0.2 m s⁻¹ air sheet that disperses humidity pockets and prevents fungal diseases like powdery mildew, ensuring petals and leaves remain immaculate and blemish-free.
- The **Electrostatic Pollen Lift** automatically self-pollinates blooms without physical contact, enabling seed production for varieties like **Calendula ‘Golden Byte’** while keeping the delicate petals perfectly clean and intact for harvest.
- The **NanoSunBeam™** system can be tuned to enhance specific pigments; for instance, boosting UV-A can intensify the purple hues in **Pansy ‘Urban-Violet’** and the red veins in **Red Amaranth Micro ‘Ruby Veil’**.

###### 3. The Delicate Harvest
The PetalBloom system is designed for handling delicate crops without damage.
- For continuous production, the **Cut-and-Come-Again Optical Mapping** guides the harvest of leaves from **Shungiku ‘Chop-Chop’** and **Wasabi Arugula ‘Nano-Wasabi’**, ensuring the core remains to regrow.
- Flowers are snipped by hand or with the **Magnetic Snip-Bot** for a pristine, automated cut.
- The **Self-Drying Flower Shelf** can be activated post-harvest to gently remove residual moisture from petals, ensuring they arrive on the plate dry and plate-ready.
- The system provides a **continuous yield of 60–100g of perfect edible flowers and delicate greens per week.**
