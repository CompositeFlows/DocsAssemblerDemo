##### How It Works

###### 1. The Clonal Cutting
Lǜ Sēnlín’s nursery supplies pre-rooted cuttings, selected from superior mother plants known for their potent flavour and aroma profiles. This clonal propagation ensures every **Patio Rosemary ‘AromiStax’** and **Genovese Pesto Mint™** you grow is genetically identical to our award-winning cultivars, guaranteeing consistent potency and performance.

###### 2. Aeroponic Intensity in the Module
Once the cuttings are placed in the AeroHerb module, HarvestSage™ initiates a specialized program for phytochemical optimization:
- A **low-pressure aeroponic tree** generates a nutrient-dense fog, surrounding the bare roots for instantaneous water and nutrient uptake.
- The **NanoSunBeam™** system delivers intense blue and UV-A spectra, intentionally stressing the plants to trigger a defence response that massively increases terpene and flavonoid production.
- The **PureLight™** glazing maintains a stable canopy temperature, preventing heat stress that can cause delicate oils to volatilize and be lost.
This combination of root-zone efficiency and spectral tuning forces the herbs to concentrate their flavours, creating an intensity typically impossible outside of ideal native habitats.

###### 3. The Sustained Flavour Harvest
The AeroHerb module is managed for continuous, potent yield.
- The **Cut-and-Come-Again Optical Mapping** system guides you to snip stems just above growth nodes, encouraging bushier regrowth.
- A gentle **Laminar Airflow Canopy** ensures humid air is dispersed, preventing mould on dense foliage like **Mini-Sweet Basil** without drying the leaves.
- The system provides a **weekly yield of 80–120g of exceptionally aromatic herbs, with terpene density measured 15-20% higher than soil-grown equivalents.**
