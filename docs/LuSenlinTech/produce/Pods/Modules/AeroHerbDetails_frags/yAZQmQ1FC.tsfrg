##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Aeroponics has been shown to accelerate growth rates by up to 30% compared to soil, as roots are never water- or oxygen-limited.
- Photostress from specific light wavelengths is a well-documented method to increase secondary metabolite production; this principle is leveraged here not for survival, but for flavour.
- By controlling every environmental variable, the system replicates the ideal "day" for oil production continuously, turning the entire growth cycle into a peak flavour period.

In short, the AeroHerb is a **phytochemical optimization chamber** that uses root-zone science and spectral stress to transform compact herbs into powerhouses of flavour, delivering restaurant-quality intensity to your crops.
