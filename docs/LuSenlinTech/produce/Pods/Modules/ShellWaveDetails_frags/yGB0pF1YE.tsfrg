##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Bivalves are exceptional bio-accumulators, making them highly susceptible to waterborne pathogens; the multi-barrier sterilization approach is critical for ensuring food safety in a recirculating system.
- The relationship between dissolved oxygen and filter-feeding rates is direct; insufficient oxygen leads to reduced feeding, slow growth, and mortality. Micro-bubble technology provides a quantum leap in gas transfer efficiency.
- Inducing dormancy through chilling pre-harvest is a standard practice in commercial shellfish aquaculture to reduce spoilage and improve shelf life; this system automates this critical step.

In short, the ShellWave is a **sanitized filtration habitat** that uses advanced gas infusion and continuous sterilization to create a pristine environment, transforming a compact tank into a reliable source of the cleanest, safest, and highest-quality molluscs.
