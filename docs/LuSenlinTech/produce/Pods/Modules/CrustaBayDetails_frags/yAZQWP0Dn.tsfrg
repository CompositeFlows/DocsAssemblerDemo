##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Biofloc technology (BFT) is a well-established method in commercial aquaculture that enhances water quality and provides a supplemental food source, drastically reducing environmental impact and operational costs.
- The key to success in BFT is maintaining a precise carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, which encourages the growth of heterotrophic bacteria over algae; this is managed automatically by the integrated AI.
- By creating a stable, miniature ecosystem, the module eliminates the need for complex filtration and frequent water changes, making aquaculture accessible and practical in a urban setting.

In short, the CrustaBay is a **self-sustaining crustacean ecosystem** that uses microbial science and precision environmental control to transform a compact tank into a personal source of the freshest, sustainably-raised shrimp and crayfish.
