#### Biofloc Crustacean Nursery

This module is an 18-litre, high-density recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) that cultivates all 10 varieties of dwarf crustaceans from our Balcony Edition catalogue. It employs advanced biofloc technology to create a self-cleaning ecosystem, producing fresh shrimp or crayfish with near-zero water exchange.
