##### How It Works

###### 1. The Pre-Colonised Block
Lǜ Sēnlín’s laboratory supplies fully colonised substrate blocks, where the mycelium has completely permeated the nutrient-rich medium. This selection - from the fast-fruiting **Oyster ‘Pearl-Fog’** to the potent **Reishi ‘Micro-Lingzhi’** - is ideal because each strain's specific fruiting triggers (temperature drops, O₂ spikes) can be perfectly executed within the sealed, programmable environment.

###### 2. Controlled Fruiting in the Module
Once the block is inserted into the MycoNest, HarvestSage™ initiates a species-specific fruiting program:
- The **Dark-Cycle Chamber with O₂ Pulse** system maintains complete darkness while releasing hourly pulses of oxygen, replicating the dawn forest cues that trigger mushroom pinning (the formation of tiny mushrooms).
- A **CO₂-Scrubbing Bio-Filter** first maintains high CO₂ levels during the final stage of colonization, then scrubs it from the air to initiate the fruiting stage, preventing misshapen fruits and speeding up development.
- High humidity (90-95% RH) is constantly maintained to ensure tender, plump mushrooms without drying out.

###### 3. The Rapid-Cycle Harvest
The MycoNest is designed for fast, clean, and continuous harvests.
- When mushrooms reach peak size and before spore release, the entire block is accessed.
- The **Pop-Out Grow-Block Sleeve** allows the spent substrate to be slid out and a new, pre-colonised block to be swapped in under 5 seconds, with zero mess or crumblintm.
- After harvest, the **Sterile UV-C Pulse** automatically disinfects the empty chamber, preventing cross-contamination between cycles.
- The system provides a **rapid yield, producing 200–400g of pristine mushrooms per block over a 7-14 day fruiting cycle.**
