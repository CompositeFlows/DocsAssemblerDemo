#### Dual-Zone Stem Forge

This module is a multi-tiered hydroponic system specifically engineered for a select group of stem-intensive vegetables from our Balcony Edition catalogue. It uses a split-rootzone approach to independently optimize conditions for stem crunch and root function, producing exceptionally crisp, juicy, and robust stems and bulbs.
