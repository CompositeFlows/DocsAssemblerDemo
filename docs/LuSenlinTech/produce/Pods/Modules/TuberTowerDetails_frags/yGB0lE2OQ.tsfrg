##### How It Works

###### 1. The Pre-Sown Cassette
Lǜ Sēnlín supplies pre-sown, biodegradable cassettes for each variety. These are not seeds but young seedlings that have been germinated under ideal conditions, giving you a head start on the growing season. The selection is ideal for succession planting, allowing you to harvest different roots from the same tower throughout its cycle.

###### 2. Precision Root Development
Once the cassette is inserted into its tier, HarvestSage™ takes over, delivering a customized program for each root type:
- **For Carrots & Beets:** The system uses **Moisture-Gradient Aerated Columns** to create a gentle moisture gradient, encouraging strong, straight taproots to drive downward without forkintm.
- **For Kohlrabi & Turnips:** A consistent moisture level is maintained to support the rapid swelling of the crisp, edible globular stem (kohlrabi) and root (turnip).
- **For All:** A specialized, loose, and deep **Micro-Bead Capillary Substrate** prevents compaction and allows for effortless harvestintm.

###### 3. The Staggered Harvest
The TuberTower is designed for continuous enjoyment. You don't have to harvest it all at once.
- **Baby Greens First:** You can begin by thinning and harvesting the young, tender leaves of the beets and turnips as microgreens.
- **Roots at Peak:** The **Harvest-Ready Green Door Light** on each tier will glow green when the roots below have reached their ideal size and sugar content.
- **Simple Extraction:** A gentle pull is all it takes to lift unblemished, clean roots from the loose substrate. The average yield is a **continuous supply of 150-200g of roots per tier, every 6-8 weeks.**
