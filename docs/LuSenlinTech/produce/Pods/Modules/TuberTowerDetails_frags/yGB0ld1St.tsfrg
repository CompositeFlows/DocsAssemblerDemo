##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- The specific substrate and moisture control eliminate the primary causes of misshapen roots - soil compaction and irregular watering - ensuring market-quality produce every time.
- Dwarf and rapid-maturing varieties are selected specifically for their performance in controlled, shallow-depth environments.
- By managing the root zone as a critical component, the system optimizes for the one part of the plant you actually eat, maximizing efficiency and flavour.

In short, the TuberTower is a **dedicated root vegetable engine** that turns a small footprint into a reliable source of the most flavourful and perfectly formed carrots, beets, turnips, and kohlrabi.
