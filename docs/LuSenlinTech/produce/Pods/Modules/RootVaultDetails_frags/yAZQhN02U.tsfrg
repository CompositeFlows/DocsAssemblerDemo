###### Technologies  

- **PureLight™** - transmits 95% of light of glass whilst providing superior insulation (~0.002–0.005 W/m·K). It is lightweight, durable, maximizes photosynthesis by maintaining stable temperatures for year-round crop growth.
- **HydraRail™ Fluid Manifold** - micro-drip, fog, or flood modes selectable per Frame; self-sealing/healing NanoHealShield™ couplers prevent spills. Change crops or switch to aquaponics on the fly.
- **HydraPad™** - a smart hydroponic insert that uses a bio-engineered nanofiber matrix and quantum sensors to optimize aquatic plant growth and enable 95% nutrient recycling, with a SlideLock™ mechanism for 10-second swaps.
- **HydraRail™ Fog Nozzles** – quick-connect misters that plug into the frame's magnetic fluid bus; software toggles each port between fog, drip or off without hardware swaps.
- **NanoSunBeam™** Organic-phosphor LEDs auto-tune PAR, far-red & UV-A. Better flavour, longer shelf life, lower kWh.
- **RFID Seed-Pad Cartridges** – single-use seed mats embedded with passive RFID chips. HarvestSage™ reads variety, sow-date and recipe, then logs the full life-cycle for traceability.
- **Moisture-Gradient Aerated Columns** – root tubes with dry, aerated tops and moist bases, steering tap-roots downward for uniform shape.
- **Micro-Bead Capillary Substrate** – 1 mm porous glass beads wick moisture yet drain instantly; a five-minute steam pulse sterilises them between crops.
- **Side-Eject Drawer** – sliding carriage pulls the entire root column horizontally, avoiding media compaction or tap-root breakage.
- **PrecisionHeat™**  - Graphene Heat-Film, printed onto root chamber walls for ±0.3°C control.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Root-Film** – graphene heater layer fused to root-chamber walls; PID control holds ±0.3 °C, boosting germination and slashing energy when inactive zones power down.
- **Graphene Lateral Heat-Loops** – printed graphene traces snake through the rhizome slab, keeping tubers at the starch-sweet 24–26 °C band.
- **Telescoping Trellis & Smart Winch** – motorised lattice extends with the vine; tension sensors rewind slack to prevent stem breakage or shading.
- **Ultrasonic RhizoShield™** – low-power transducers shake root hairs loose at harvest, allowing tubers to lift clean with minimal substrate cling.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Endoscopic Root-Sizer** – 4 mm probe scans root diameter via structured light and illuminates the door handle when target size is reached.
- **Roll-Out Rhizome Drawer** – 150 mm-deep aerated bio-foam bed slides out fully, letting sweet-potato vines sprawl without media spill.
- **Side-Eject Drawer** – sliding carriage pulls the entire root column horizontally, avoiding media compaction or tap-root breakage.
- **Near-Infra-Red Dry-Matter Sensor** – NIR diode reads starch content; when it crosses a user-set threshold the module flags "Starch-Peak."
- **Harvest-Ready Green Door Light** – handle glows green when biomass, size or aroma sensors confirm peak quality.  
- **Drawer-Assist Lift Handle** – gas-spring grip lets users slide the 150 mm rhizome bed out with one hand.
- **Starch-Peak Door Light** – indicator tied to the NIR sensor glows when tuber starch hits the user-defined sweetness threshold.
