##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- The hydrotropic response - a root's growth toward moisture - is a fundamental plant behaviour. This system doesn't just water plants; it uses water as a tool to architecturally guide and form the edible portion of the crop.
- Traditional harvesting of root vegetables is inherently destructive and can damage up to 30% of the crop. The horizontal ejection mechanism preserves 100% of the yield in perfect condition.
- By removing the variables of inconsistent watering and soil compaction - the two main causes of deformed roots - the system guarantees a visually perfect and consistently textured harvest every time.

In short, the RootVault is a **root-shaping cultivation system** that uses hydrotropic guidance and non-destructive harvesting to deliver impossibly straight, clean, and flawless root vegetables directly from a vertical column to your kitchen.
