#### Mist-Propelled Aromatic Engine

This module is a compact, high-density aeroponic cube specifically engineered for the 15 varieties of oil-rich aromatic herbs in our catalogue. It suspends roots in a cool, oxygen-rich nutrient fog while NanoSunBeamâ„¢ LEDs bathe the canopy in tailored spectra to dramatically boost essential oil and terpene production.
