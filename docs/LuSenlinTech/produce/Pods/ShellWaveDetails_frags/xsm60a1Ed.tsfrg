#### Pristine Bivalve Habitat

This module is a 15-litre recirculating aquaculture system specifically engineered for all 10 species of filter-feeding molluscs in our Balcony Edition catalogue. It maintains a sterile, oxygen-rich aquatic environment to support the delicate metabolism of bivalves, producing clean, sweet, and safe shellfish.

##### How It Works

###### 1. The Juvenile Spat
Lǜ Sēnlín’s hatchery supplies juvenile shellfish (spat), carefully settled on appropriate substrates. This selection—from the fast-filtering **Urban Mussel ‘Closed-Sea’** to the delicate **Micro Scallop ‘Sweet-Dot’**—is ideal because these species are entirely dependent on pristine, particle-rich water for respiration and nutrition, a condition this system is designed to maintain flawlessly.

###### 2. Sterile Cultivation in the Module
Once the spat are introduced to the ShellWave tank, HarvestSage™ initiates a specialized mollusc program:
- The ****Micro-Bubble Column** – ceramic diffuser creates < 100 µm bubbles, pushing dissolved O₂ to ~10 mg L⁻¹ - ideal for bivalve filter-feeding.** super-saturates the water with dissolved oxygen, pushing levels to ~10 mg L⁻¹, which is essential for the high metabolic demands of filter-feeding.
- The ****UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.** operates continuously, creating a closed-loop sterilization system that flashes water with 254 nm UV-C light and doses 0.1 ppm ozone, eliminating bacteria, viruses, and protozoa without any chemicals.
- The ****Real-Time Turbidity & pH Sensors** – optical and electrochemical probes guard water clarity and acidity, prompting automatic corrections.** guard water clarity and acidity, ensuring the environment remains stable for shell formation and overall health.

###### 3. The Dormancy Harvest
The ShellWave ensures the highest quality and ease of harvest through physiological management.
- Two hours before your planned harvest, the ****Auto-Chill to 4 °C** – thermoelectric chiller drops mollusc temperature two hours pre-harvest, inducing dormancy.** system activates, gradually lowering the water temperature to 4°C.
- This cold shock induces a dormant state in the molluscs, causing them to close their shells tightly. This reduces stress, preserves their internal moisture (liquor), and makes them easier to handle and store.
- Harvesting is then a simple process of collecting the dormant, closed-shell bivalves from the tank.
- The system provides a **yield of 180–250g of chilled, dormant molluscs per full production cycle.**

##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Bivalves are exceptional bio-accumulators, making them highly susceptible to waterborne pathogens; the multi-barrier sterilization approach is critical for ensuring food safety in a recirculating system.
- The relationship between dissolved oxygen and filter-feeding rates is direct; insufficient oxygen leads to reduced feeding, slow growth, and mortality. Micro-bubble technology provides a quantum leap in gas transfer efficiency.
- Inducing dormancy through chilling pre-harvest is a standard practice in commercial shellfish aquaculture to reduce spoilage and improve shelf life; this system automates this critical step.

In short, the ShellWave is a **sanitized filtration habitat** that uses advanced gas infusion and continuous sterilization to create a pristine environment, transforming a compact tank into a reliable source of the cleanest, safest, and highest-quality molluscs.

###### ShellWave Technologies  

- **Rotating Drum Filter** – mesh drum continuously strains solids; a backwash jet cleans the screen automatically into a compost stream.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Water Jacket** – liquid jacket regulates aquaculture temperature within ±0.2 °C via solid-state Peltier plates.
- **Real-Time Turbidity & pH Sensors** – optical and electrochemical probes guard water clarity and acidity, prompting automatic corrections.
- **Micro-Bubble Column** – ceramic diffuser creates < 100 µm bubbles, pushing dissolved O₂ to ~10 mg L⁻¹ - ideal for bivalve filter-feeding.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.
- **Rotating Drum Filter** – mesh drum continuously strains solids; a backwash jet cleans the screen automatically into a compost stream.
- **Protein Skimmer + UV-C Loop** – foam-fractionator strips dissolved organics while an inline UV-C tube neutralises free-floating pathogens.
- **Moving-Bed Nitrification Cartridge** – floating bio-media tumble in an aerated chamber, converting ammonia to nitrate and stabilising water quality.
- **Laminar-Flow Oval Tank** – 40 L oval vessel with variable impellers that mimic anything from koi-pond ripples to trout-stream currents.
- **Thermoelectric Plate Chiller** – solid-state cooler that drops tank temperature to 12 °C for cold-water trout without external chillers.
- **In-Situ Insect-Larvae Feeder** – hopper breeds black soldier fly larvae from kitchen scraps; doses live grubs for high-protein, zero-cost feed.
- **Shallow Raceway with Swirl-Flow Control** – flat 3 L tray whose paddle wheel shifts from laminar flow (duckweed) to vortex (spirulina) on demand.

###### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Robotic Dip-Net** – articulated scoop sizes shrimp, nets only mature ones and transfers them to an ice-cooled side pocket.
- **Auto-Chill to 4 °C** – thermoelectric chiller drops mollusc temperature two hours pre-harvest, inducing dormancy.
- **App-Selectable Harvest Modes** – mobile app toggles FinWave between bulk harvest, staggered take or ornamental display.
- **Smart Net Guide** – retractable gate herds fish into a front catch pocket for stress-free capture.
