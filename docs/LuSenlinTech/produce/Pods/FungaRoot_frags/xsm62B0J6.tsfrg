#### Truffle-Inoculated Root Vegetables

This module uses a selection of compact roots—Finger Carrot, Baby Beet, Tokyo Turnip, and Baby Kohlrabi—that have been pre-colonised (inoculated) with truffle-forming mycorrhizal fungi before being installed in the FungaRoot unit.

##### How It Works

###### 1. The Starter Plug

Lǜ Sēnlín’s nursery cultivates young Finger Carrots, Baby Beets, Tokyo Turnips, and Baby Kohlrabi in a sterile substrate, pre-inoculated with spores or vegetative mycelium of edible truffle species (e.g., *Tuber melanosporum* or the faster-fruiting *Tuber borchii*).
This specific selection is ideal because these roots thrive in the well-drained, aerated medium that truffles require. Their varied root structures provide a large, diverse surface area for the mycelium to colonize, creating a robust symbiotic network.

###### 2. Symbiosis in the Module

Once the plug is inserted into the FungaRoot module, HarvestSage™ maintains the precise environmental conditions to trigger truffle formation:
- A high pH (7.5–8.0)
- A stable temperature of ~18 °C
- Alternating moist and brief-dry cycles
These conditions encourage the fungus to form a mycorrhizal mantle around the roots. Over approximately 14 weeks, the roots develop for harvest while the truffle mycelium simultaneously produces small fruiting bodies (mini "button" truffles, 1–2 cm in size).

###### 3. The Dual Harvest

When the door light turns green, you pull out the drawer to collect both crops:
- Harvest the mature Finger Carrots, Baby Beets, Tokyo Turnips, and Baby Kohlrabi.
- Pick the attached truffle nuggets from the root system and surrounding substrate.
The average yield from the 500 mm cube module is **450 g of assorted root vegetables plus 30–40 g of fresh truffle per cycle.**

##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Studies have demonstrated that truffle mycelium can form symbiotic relationships with a wide range of host plants, including herbaceous roots, and will produce fruiting bodies under controlled conditions.
- Advances in micro-controlled pH, moisture, and CO₂—common in 2035 vertical farming systems—allow us to replicate the calcareous soils and seasonal cues truffles require, but on a countertop scale.

In short, this system is a **dual-crop root cassette** where a selection of gourmet edible roots serves as a living host for truffle fungi, providing a varied vegetable harvest and bite-size black truffles from a single, compact module.

##### Technologies  

- **Dual-Kingdom Substrate Cassette** – split block: loamy upper layer for vegetables, alkaline limestone lower layer for truffle mycelium, enabling dual harvests.
- **PrecisionHeat™ Root-Film** – graphene heater layer fused to root-chamber walls; PID control holds ±0.3 °C, boosting germination and slashing energy when inactive zones power down.
- **Moisture-Gradient Aerated Columns** – root tubes with dry, aerated tops and moist bases, steering tap-roots downward for uniform shape.
- **UV-C/Ozone Steril Loop** – closed loop flashes water with 254 nm UV-C then doses 0.1 ppm ozone, wiping microbes without chemicals.

##### Harvest Enhancements
  
- **Truffle Sniff Sensor** – nano-chemiresistor detects volatile sulfur compounds unique to ripe truffles and pings the user.
- **Side-Eject Drawer** – sliding carriage pulls the entire root column horizontally, avoiding media compaction or tap-root breakage.
- **Drawer-Assist Lift Handle** – gas-spring grip lets users slide the 150 mm rhizome bed out with one hand.
- **Harvest-Ready Green Door Light** – handle glows green when biomass, size or aroma sensors confirm peak quality.
