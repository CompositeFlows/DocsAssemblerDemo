##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
The blend has a remarkably neutral, mildly grassy, and slightly sweet flavour, often compared to fresh green peas or alfalfa sprouts. Its tiny, leaf-like fronds (thalli) create a delicate, caviar-like texture that disappears into dishes, making it a true "stealth health" ingredient.

###### 2. A Versatile Protein Powerhouse
This blend is designed to be a foundational, everyday protein source.
- **The Ultimate Smoothie Booster:** A single scoop blended into a morning smoothie effortlessly adds 5-7 grams of complete protein without altering the flavour or texture.
- **Vegan Culinary Applications:** Mix fresh into veggie burger patties, falafel, or savoury pancakes to bind ingredients and boost nutritional value. Dehydrated and ground into a fine, vibrant green "Lentein" flour, it can be added to pasta, bread, and baked goods.
- **Garnish & Topping:** Use fresh as a nutritious, elegant garnish for soups, salads, and grain bowls, adding a pop of colour and a subtle fresh flavour.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The blend grows as a floating mat that doubles its biomass every 24-48 hours. Harvesting is a simple process of skimming the surface. A standard Macro-Mesh™ mat provides a **continuous yield of 40–60g of fresh, protein-rich biomass daily**, which can be used immediately, refrigerated for a week, or dehydrated for long-term storage.
