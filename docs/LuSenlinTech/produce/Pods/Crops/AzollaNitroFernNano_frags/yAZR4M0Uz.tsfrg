##### The Science & Story Behind It

This fern is a miniature marvel of natural engineering:
- Azolla forms a symbiosis with the cyanobacterium *Anabaena azollae*, which lives in cavities within its leaves. The bacterium converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a form of nitrogen the plant can use, a process known as nitrogen fixation.
- For centuries, it has been used in rice paddies in Southeast Asia as a natural fertilizer, famously referred to as "green manure."
- The Azolla fern event is a paleontological hypothesis that suggests a massive bloom of Azolla in the Arctic Ocean 49 million years ago played a key role in transitioning the Earth from a "greenhouse" to an "icehouse" climate by drawing down atmospheric CO₂.

In short, **Azolla ‘Nitro-Fern Nano’** is a **symbiotic nutrient engine**, a living link to ancient planetary processes that you can harness to create a more fertile and sustainable closed-loop garden.
