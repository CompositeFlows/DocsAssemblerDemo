##### The Science & Story Behind It

‘Mini-Marsh’ is a testament to survival and flavour:
- As a true halophyte, it has specialized salt glands that actively excrete excess salt onto its surface, allowing it to thrive in saline environments that would dehydrate and kill ordinary plants. You are literally tasting its survival mechanism.
- It is a pioneer species in salt marshes, helping to stabilize sediment and create habitats for other organisms. Its cultivation in controlled systems provides a sustainable alternative to wild harvesting from fragile coastal ecosystems.
- Beyond its sodium content, it is rich in vitamins A and C, as well as essential minerals like iodine and magnesium absorbed from the nutrient-rich water, making it a genuinely healthy "salty" snack.

In short, **Salicornia ‘Mini-Marsh’** is a **self-seasoning succulent from the sea**, a burst of oceanic freshness that brings the invigorating crunch of the coast directly to your plate.
