##### The Science & Story Behind It

This plant is a marvel of aquatic adaptation and culinary history:
- Its scientific name, *Ipomoea aquatica*, reveals it is a cousin of the sweet potato. It shares the same genus but has been selected for its delicious leafy greens rather than its tubers.
- The hollow stems are a specialized adaptation (aerenchyma) that allows the plant to thrive in flooded conditions, transporting oxygen from the leaves down to the submerged roots. This same structure is what gives it its uniquely crisp texture.
- In many parts of Southeast Asia, it is not just a vegetable but a foraged staple, often collected from canals and riverbanks. ‘Aqua-Morning’ brings this wild, prolific spirit into a clean, controlled, and continuous harvest.

In short, **Water Spinach ‘Aqua-Morning’** is a **prolific aquatic green**, a textural marvel that turns the simple act of cooking greens into a vibrant, crunchy, and deeply satisfying experience.
