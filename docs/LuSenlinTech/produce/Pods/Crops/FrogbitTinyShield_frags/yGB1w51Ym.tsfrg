##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
The leaves and petioles (stem stalks) offer an exceptionally clean, crisp, and mildly sweet flavour with subtle cucumber-like notes. The texture is its standout feature—a satisfying, airy crunch similar to iceberg lettuce, but more delicate. The entire plant, from its tiny roots to its perfect round leaves, is edible.

###### 2. A Delicate Garnish & Crunchy Accent
Its primary role is to add visual elegance and a light, fresh crunch.
- **The Ultimate Floating Garnish:** An exquisite, edible garnish for cold soups, particularly gazpacho and vichyssoise, where it floats artistically. It also adds a beautiful touch to seafood dishes, cocktails, and summer salads.
- **Salad & Taco Topper:** Provides a unique, crunchy texture in mixed green salads or as a fresh, unexpected topping for fish tacos and ceviche.
- **Quick-Pickled Delicacy:** The stems and leaves can be lightly quick-pickled in rice vinegar, enhancing their crunch and adding a sweet-and-sour note that complements rich dishes like pork or duck.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant reproduces rapidly by sending out runners, forming a dense mat on the water's surface. Harvesting is as simple as skimming the desired quantity of individual plants from the surface. A single Macro-Mesh™ mat provides a **continuous, abundant yield of 30–50g of pristine, ready-to-eat foliage daily.**
