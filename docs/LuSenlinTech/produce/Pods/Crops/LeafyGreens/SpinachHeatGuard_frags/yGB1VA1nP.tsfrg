###### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar represents a victory over a plant's most basic biological imperative:
- The "HeatGuard" trait is the result of selecting for spinach plants with a recessive "bolting" gene. This genetic tweak dramatically slows the plant's response to photoperiod (day length) and temperature, the two primary environmental cues that initiate the flowering process.
- Its sweet flavour is linked to a favourable sugar-to-oxalate ratio. Oxalic acid is the compound that can contribute to a harsh, metallic aftertaste and the chalky mouthfeel in some spinach; 'HeatGuard' has been selected for lower oxalate levels alongside higher sugar content.
- Unlike many slow-bolting varieties that sacrifice flavour or leaf texture for resilience, ‘HeatGuard’ maintains the delicate, succulent cell structure of the best salad spinach, ensuring it wilts perfectly without becoming slimy.

In short, **Spinach ‘HeatGuard’** is a **bolt-defying tender classic**, a genetic solution to the gardener's oldest spinach problem, delivering a prolonged, reliable harvest of sweet, tender leaves perfect for both fresh eating and cooking.
