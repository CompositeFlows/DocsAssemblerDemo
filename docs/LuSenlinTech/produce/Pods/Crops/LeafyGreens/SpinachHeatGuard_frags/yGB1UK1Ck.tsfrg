This is a true breakthrough in spinach cultivation, a slow-bolting cultivar specifically engineered to resist the trigger of long, warm days that cause traditional spinach to rapidly flower and turn bitter. ‘HeatGuard’ delivers the classic, sweet, and slightly metallic flavour of perfect spinach, providing an extended harvest window even on a sun-drenched balcony.
