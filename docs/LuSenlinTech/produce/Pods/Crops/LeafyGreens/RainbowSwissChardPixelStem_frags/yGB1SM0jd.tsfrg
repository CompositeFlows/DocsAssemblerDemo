This is an ornamental and culinary masterpiece, a Swiss chard cultivar bred for a stunning display of vividly coloured, jewel-toned stems alongside exceptionally tender, savoury leaves. ‘Pixel-Stem’ produces a compact, upright clump where each plant is a unique specimen, featuring stems in electric shades of magenta, orange, gold, and white, making the harvest as beautiful as it is delicious.
