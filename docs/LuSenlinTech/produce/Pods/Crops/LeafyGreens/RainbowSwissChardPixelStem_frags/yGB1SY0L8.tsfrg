###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Pixel-Stem’ offers the classic, earthy, and slightly salty-mineral flavour of Swiss chard. The leaves are tender with a texture similar to spinach but more substantial, while the stems are crisp, juicy, and mildly sweet. The plant forms a tight, upright cluster of stems, each a different vibrant colour, with deep green, heavily savoyed leaves.

**2. A Dual-Harvest of Colour & Flavour**
This chard is two vegetables in one, with both parts requiring different cooking approaches.
- **Sautéed Stems & Leaves:** A classic preparation. Chop the colourful stems and sauté them first with garlic, then add the chopped leaves and wilt them down. The colours create a stunning visual in the pan and on the plate.
- **Raw Salads & Pickles:** Young, tender leaves can be used raw in salads. The vibrant stems can be thinly sliced for a colourful crunch in salads or quick-pickled to make a dazzling, gourmet condiment.
- **Gratins & Quiches:** Adds beautiful colour and a robust, earthy flavour to egg dishes, gratins, and savoury tarts.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
The plant is a cut-and-come-again perennial. Harvest by snapping off the outer stems at the base, which encourages new, brightly coloured stems to emerge from the center. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous and visually spectacular yield of 3-5 multi-coloured stems, with leaves, per week from a single plant.**
