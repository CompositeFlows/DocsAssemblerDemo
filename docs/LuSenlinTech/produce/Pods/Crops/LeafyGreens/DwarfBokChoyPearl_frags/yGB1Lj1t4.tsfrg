##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a masterpiece of efficient plant morphology:
- The sweet, non-bitter flavour is a result of a low concentration of glucosinolates that produce sharp, pungent flavours in other brassicas like mustard greens. This makes it one of the most approachable and universally liked Asian greens.
- Its compact, self-wrapping habit is due to a shortened stem (core) and petioles (stalks) that grow in a tightly overlapping, upright fashion. This is a selected trait that prevents the plant from splaying open, protecting the delicate inner heart and maximizing space efficiency.
- The stark colour contrast between the white stems and dark green leaves is a sign of high nutrient diversity. The white stems are packed with water and fibre, while the dark green leaves are rich in chlorophyll, vitamins A and C, and calcium.

In short, **Dwarf Bok-Choy ‘Pearl’** is a **perfectly proportioned textural duo**, a rapid-growing miniature that delivers the complete sweet, crunchy, and tender bok choy experience in a single, beautiful, and personal-sized package.
