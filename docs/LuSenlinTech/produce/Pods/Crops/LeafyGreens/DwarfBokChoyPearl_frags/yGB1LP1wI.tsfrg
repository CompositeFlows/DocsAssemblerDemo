##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘Pearl’ offers the quintessential bok choy profile: a mild, sweet, and slightly peppery flavour with a clean, refreshing finish. Its appeal lies in its texture contrast—the crunchy, juicy, celery-like stalks (petioles) and the soft, velvety green leaves. The plant forms a perfect, compact cup-shaped head, typically 10-15 cm tall.

###### 2. The Versatile Asian Green
This miniature bok choy is incredibly adaptable to various cooking methods.
- **Stir-Fry & Steam:** The premier use. Its small size means it cooks quickly and evenly, becoming tender-crisp. A classic in garlic stir-fries and a perfect vehicle for oyster sauce.
- **Soups & Broths:** Adds substance, texture, and gentle sweetness to clear broths, ramen, and hot pots. The stems remain slightly crisp while the leaves wilt delicately.
- **Roasted or Grilled:** Halved or quartered, it can be roasted or grilled, developing a delicious caramelized sweetness on the stems while the leaves become crispy.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a fast-growing, single-heading variety. For a continuous harvest, outer leaves can be picked, but the classic method is a full harvest by cutting the entire head at the base. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **rapid yield of one perfect, 80–120g head approximately 30-35 days from planting.**
