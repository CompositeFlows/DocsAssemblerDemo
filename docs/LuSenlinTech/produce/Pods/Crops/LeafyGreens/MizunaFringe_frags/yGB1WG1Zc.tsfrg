A pinnacle of texture and architectural beauty, ‘Fringe’ is a mizuna cultivar selected for its exceptionally fine, feathery, and deeply serrated leaves. Bred to thrive in the controlled chaos of a balcony garden, it offers a rapid, continuous harvest of leaves that are as visually striking as they are delicious. This variety combines the peppery-mustard punch characteristic of the brassica family with a surprising tenderness, making it a versatile and productive choice for the urban gardener.
