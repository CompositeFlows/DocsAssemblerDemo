True to its name, ‘Rocket-Flash’ is a hyper-fast, compact arugula bred for the impatient urban gardener. It delivers the signature peppery punch that arugula lovers crave, but in a remarkably short time from seed to salad bowl. This cultivar is engineered to resist bolting under stress, ensuring that the sharp, complex flavour lasts for multiple harvests, making it the most reliable and rapid source of piquant greens for your balcony.
