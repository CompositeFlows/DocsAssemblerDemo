###### The Science & Story Behind It

The breakthrough of ‘Hydro-Pepper’ lies in adapting an obligate aquatic plant to a container environment without sacrificing its defining characteristics.
- The "Hydro" trait involves selecting for a more robust and efficient root system that can tolerate the lower oxygen levels of a static, well-aerated water reservoir, unlike wild watercress which requires flowing, highly oxygenated water.
- Its potent, stable peppery flavour is derived from a consistent production of glucosinolates, particularly phenethyl glucosinolate (which breaks down into the sharp phenethyl isothiocyanate). The breeding ensures this chemical defence mechanism remains highly active, providing the classic "clean heat" without the bitterness that can arise in stressed plants.
- The hallmark crispness and juiciness are maintained by enhancing the structure and turgor pressure of the stem's aerenchyma cells—the specialized, air-filled tissues that give watercress its buoyancy and signature succulent snap.

In short, **Watercress ‘Hydro-Pepper’** is a **potent, self-watering, and crisply aquatic** green, a feat of modern breeding that captures the untamed spirit of a streamside forage in the convenience of a balcony planter.
