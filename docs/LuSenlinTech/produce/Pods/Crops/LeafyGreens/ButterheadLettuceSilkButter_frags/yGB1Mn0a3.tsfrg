This is the epitome of tender-leaf luxury, a butterhead cultivar selected for an exceptionally soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture and a subtly sweet, buttery flavour. ‘Silk-Butter’ forms a beautiful, loose rosette of delicate, pliable leaves that are the very definition of salad sophistication, offering a lush, velvety contrast to crisper greens.
