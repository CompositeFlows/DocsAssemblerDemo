This is a vertical marvel of lettuce breeding, a romaine cultivar that grows in a tight, upright column rather than a sprawling head. ‘Skyline Romaine’ delivers the classic sweet, crisp, and juicy heart of traditional romaine with a remarkably compact footprint, making it the perfect architectural green for dense vertical farming and small-space gardens.
