###### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a masterclass in efficient growth and natural hardiness:
- Its remarkably fast growth cycle is a result of selective breeding for rapid leaf initiation and expansion, allowing it to quickly form a photosynthetic canopy and outcompete weeds—a trait perfectly suited for successive planting in a balcony farm.
- The dark green colour indicates a high chlorophyll content, and as a brassica, it is also rich in glucosinolates, compounds being studied for their potential health-promoting properties when converted to isothiocyanates during chewing or chopping.
- Its distinctive flat, ground-hugging growth habit is a natural adaptation for survival, protecting the vital growing point from pests and harsh weather. This very trait also makes it an ideal "living mulch" that suppresses weeds in a mixed planting.

In short, **Tatsoi ‘Sprint’** is a **resilient, rapid-producing flavour bomb**, a robust and versatile green that delivers a continuous, fast harvest of peppery, succulent leaves, making it one of the most productive and reliable plants for the urban gardener.
