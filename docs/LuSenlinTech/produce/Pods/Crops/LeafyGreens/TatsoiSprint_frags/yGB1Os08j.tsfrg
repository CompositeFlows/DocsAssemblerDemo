###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Sprint’ offers a complex, bold flavour—a pleasant, peppery kick reminiscent of mild mustard greens, balanced by a deep, spinach-like earthiness and a satisfying, succulent crunch. Its leaves are dark green, spoon-shaped, and form a very flat, dense rosette against the soil (or growing medium), often called a "flat cabbage" formation.

**2. The Versatile Brassica Workhorse**
This green's sturdy texture and bold flavour make it incredibly versatile across culinary traditions.
- **Stir-fries & Soups:** A classic in Asian cuisine, it wilts quickly in stir-fries and adds substance and flavour to soups and hot pots without becoming slimy.
- **Raw in Salads:** Young, tender leaves add a spicy, robust element to mixed green salads, providing a textural and flavourful contrast to milder lettuces.
- **Sautéed Side:** Briefly sautéed with garlic and a splash of soy sauce or sesame oil, it makes for a simple, nutritious, and deeply flavourful side dish.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
The plant is a fast-growing, cut-and-come-again variety. Harvest by slicing the entire rosette about an inch above the base, and it will often regrow for a second, smaller harvest. Alternatively, pick the outer leaves continuously. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **very rapid yield, producing a full 100–150g rosette in as little as 25-30 days.**
