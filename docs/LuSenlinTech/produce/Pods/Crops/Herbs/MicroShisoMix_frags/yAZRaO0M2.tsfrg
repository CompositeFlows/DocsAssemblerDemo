##### The Science & Story Behind It

This mix captures the essence of a cornerstone of Japanese cuisine in its most potent form:
- The distinctive aroma of shiso comes from perillaldehyde, a compound unique to this genus, which provides the complex cinnamon-anise flavour that is irreplaceable in Japanese cooking.
- Red shiso's colour comes from a pigment called shisonin, which not only provides its brilliant hue but also has documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making the herb as healthy as it is beautiful.
- By harvesting at the micro-leaf stage, the plant's secondary metabolites—the compounds responsible for its unique flavour and colour—are at their peak concentration, delivering a more intense experience than mature leaves.

In short, the **Micro-Shiso Mix** is a **concentrated essence of Japan**, a powerful duo of aromatic micro-greens that delivers a lifetime of flavour in a single, prolific cut, bringing the authentic, complex taste of a Tokyo sushi bar directly to your balcony.
