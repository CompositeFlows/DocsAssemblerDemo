This is a curated mix of two iconic Japanese herbs, selected for their intense flavour and harvested at the micro-leaf stage. The Micro-Shiso Mix delivers a powerful, complex taste of cinnamon, mint, anise, and citrus in a delicate, tender form, providing the authentic essence of shiso for garnishes and salads without the need for a full-sized plant.
