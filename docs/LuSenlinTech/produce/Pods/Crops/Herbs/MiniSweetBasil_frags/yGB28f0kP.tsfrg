##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar represents the pinnacle of culinary bio-engineering:
- The "4.1" designation signifies its lineage; it is the result of four generations of phenotypic selection for compact growth and oil density, with a final, stable genetic tweak (the ".1") to virtually eliminate premature flowering (bolting), ensuring a long harvest window.
- The signature basil aroma comes from a high concentration of linalool and estragole, volatile compounds that are most potent just before the plant flowers. By delaying bolting, '4.1' maintains peak flavour for weeks longer than standard varieties.
- Unlike many dwarf plants, it has not sacrificed flavour for size. Its compact stature is due to shorter internodal spacing, meaning the leaves—and their oil glands—are actually more densely packed than in a larger plant.

In short, **Mini-Sweet Basil 4.1** is a **genetically stabilized flavour bomb**, a living testament to the idea that the most authentic tastes can be perfected for modern life, delivering the soul of Italy from a single, prolific plant on your balcony.
