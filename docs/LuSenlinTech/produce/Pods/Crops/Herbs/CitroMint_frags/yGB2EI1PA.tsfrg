##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a natural hybrid that has been perfected for the palate:
- Its signature lemon aroma comes from a high concentration of the terpene citronellal, the same compound found in lemon balm and lemongrass, which is unusually dominant over the menthol and carvone typically found in mints.
- The "dwarf" characteristic is not a deficiency; it's a result of selective breeding for shorter internodes (the spaces between leaves), which concentrates the aromatic oils and makes the plant incredibly productive for its size.
- Unlike its more vigorous mint cousins, Citro-Mint is a well-behaved clump-former with less aggressive runners, making it a polite and perfect citizen for a mixed herb planter or compact balcony garden.

In short, **Citro-Mint** is a **sunshine-infused refresher**, a compact powerhouse that condenses the joyful essence of a summer garden into a single, prolific plant, ready to brighten any dish or drink at a moment's notice.
