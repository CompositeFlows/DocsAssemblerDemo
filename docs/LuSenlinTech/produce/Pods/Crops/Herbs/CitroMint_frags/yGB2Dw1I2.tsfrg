##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
Citro-Mint delivers a dominant, zesty lemon flavour, clean and true, followed by a subtle, sweet spearmint finish that prevents any sharpness. The leaves are small, rounded, and slightly fuzzy, growing on a dense, mounding plant that rarely exceeds 20 cm in height, making it as decorative as it is useful.

###### 2. A Zest for Refreshment
This mint is the ultimate herb for brightening drinks, desserts, and light dishes without overpowering them.
- **Teas & Infusions:** The premier choice for a refreshing, caffeine-free lemon-mint tea. A single sprig elevates a glass of iced water or lemonade into a spa-like experience.
- **Desserts & Fruit Salads:** Finely chopped and sprinkled over fruit salads, sorbets, panna cotta, or fresh berries, where its citrus notes harmonize perfectly.
- **Seafood & Salads:** A brilliant garnish for grilled white fish, shrimp, and summer salads (like tabbouleh), adding a fragrant, citrusy lift that is more nuanced than lemon juice alone.
- **Cocktails:** A essential muddled ingredient for Mojitos and other summer cocktails, providing a complex citrus backbone.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant forms a tight, bushy clump ideal for small spaces. Harvest by pinching off the top sets of leaves. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous yield of 15â€“25g of intensely fragrant leaves per week.**
