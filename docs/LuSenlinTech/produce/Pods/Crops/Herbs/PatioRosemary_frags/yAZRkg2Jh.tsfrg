This is a structural and aromatic marvel—an upright, columnar rosemary cultivar bred specifically for the spatial constraints of a balcony. ‘AromiStax’ grows in a dense, compact spire, minimizing lateral sprawl while maximizing vertical production of its intensely resinous, pine-scented leaves. It delivers the robust, camphorous flavour of a wild Tuscan hillside from a perfectly architectural form.
