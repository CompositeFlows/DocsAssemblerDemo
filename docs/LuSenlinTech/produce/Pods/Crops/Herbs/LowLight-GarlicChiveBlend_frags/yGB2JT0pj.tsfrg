##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
This blend offers a dynamic range of allium flavours from a single source. The **Common Chives** provide fine, hollow leaves with a gentle, onion-like sharpness. The **Garlic Chives** contribute flat, solid blades with a distinctly stronger, more savory garlic aroma and flavor. Together, they create a complex, layered taste that is more interesting than either alone.

###### 2. The All-Purpose Allium Boost
This blend is the ultimate "finishing" herb, designed to be sprinkled over dishes just before serving to retain its delicate flavour and vibrant colour.
- **Eggs & Dairy:** A classic pairing. Stirred into soft-scrambled eggs, omelettes, or folded into cream cheese, sour cream, and butter.
- **Salads & Soups:** Provides a fresh, sharp counterpoint to green salads, potato salads, and as a garnish for creamy soups like vichyssoise.
- **Asian Stir-fries & Dumplings:** The garlic chive component is essential for dishes like *Jiaozi* (dumplings) and stir-fries, where its robust flavour stands up to high heat better than common chives.
- **Universal Garnish:** A handful snipped over grilled meats, roasted vegetables, or pasta adds an instant lift of fresh, savoury complexity.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
Both varieties in the blend are "cut-and-come-again" perennials. Harvest by snipping leaves about 2 cm from the base, which encourages new growth from the center. Supplied as a combined RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous, mixed yield of 15â€“30g of fresh chives per week, even in lower light conditions.**
