This is a pragmatic and flavourful solution for the urban gardener, combining the mild, oniony sharpness of common chives with the robust, garlicky punch of garlic chives (also known as Chinese chives). Selected specifically for their ability to thrive in the shadier conditions of a dense vertical garden or a less-than-sunny balcony, this blend ensures a reliable, continuous harvest of allium flavour regardless of your light situation.
