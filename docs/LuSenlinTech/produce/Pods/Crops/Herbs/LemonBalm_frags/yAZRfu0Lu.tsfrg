##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar connects ancient herbalism with modern phytochemistry:
- Its calming reputation is linked to compounds like rosmarinic acid and certain terpenes that are believed to have a mild sedative effect by influencing GABA receptors in the brain, though it is not as potent as prescribed medication.
- The "Citro-Edge" name refers to the selective breeding for higher concentrations of the terpenes citronellal and citral (neral and geranial), which are responsible for the pure lemon scent, while reducing levels of other terpenes that can contribute to a musty aroma.
- A member of the mint family (*Lamiaceae*), it shares their vigorous growth but ‘Citro-Edge’ has been specifically selected for a more restrained, tidely clumping habit, making it a polite and productive citizen in a mixed herb planter.

In short, **Lemon Balm ‘Citro-Edge’** is a **clarified citrus calmer**, a dual-purpose herb that offers the pure, joyful essence of lemon for your cooking and the gentle, time-honoured promise of tranquility in your teacup, all from a single, well-behaved plant.
