##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘Citro-Edge’ offers a remarkably pure and intense lemon flavour, reminiscent of lemon zest rather than the general citrus of its ancestors, with virtually none of the faintly musty backnotes. Its leaves are slightly smaller, more crinkled, and packed with aromatic oils. The plant forms a dense, upright clump, far less sprawling than common lemon balm.

###### 2. Zest for Calm & Cuisine
This balm is a versatile herb for both the kitchen and the teacup.
- **Herbal Teas & Infusions:** The premier choice for a calming, caffeine-free tea. Its vibrant lemon flavour is naturally uplifting, and when steeped, it creates a beautifully aromatic, soothing drink that has been used for centuries to ease anxiety and promote sleep.
- **Desserts & Fruit Salads:** Finely chopped and sprinkled over fruit salads, sorbets, or panna cotta, or infused into syrups for cakes and custards, where its clean citrus note shines without bitterness.
- **Savory Brightener:** A surprising and delightful addition to marinades for chicken or fish, salad dressings, and grain salads like tabbouleh, providing a lemon accent without the acidity of juice.
- **Cocktails & Lemonade:** Muddles beautifully into summer cocktails and can be used to create a more complex, herbal lemonade.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a clump-forming perennial that is non-invasive. Regular harvesting of the top leaves encourages bushier growth. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous yield of 20–35g of intensely fragrant leaves per week.**
