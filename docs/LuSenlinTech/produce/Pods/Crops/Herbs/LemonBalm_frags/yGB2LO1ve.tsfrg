This is a refined, high-potency cultivar of the ancient calming herb, bred for a brighter, cleaner lemon flavour and a more compact, well-mannered growth habit. ‘Citro-Edge’ cuts through the sometimes-muddy undertones of traditional lemon balm, delivering a sharp, zesty citrus aroma with a crisp, almost sherbet-like finish, making it equally valuable for culinary creativity and herbal wellness.
