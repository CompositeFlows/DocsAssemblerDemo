##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
Genovese Pesto Mint™ offers a profoundly different mint experience. The initial cooling menthol "blast" is replaced by a smooth, sweet, and herbaceous flavour with distinct notes of basil, citrus, and warm spice. Its leaves are larger and more tender than traditional mint, with a vibrant green colour and a potent, yet gentle, aroma.

###### 2. The Savoury Mint Revolution
This mint is a versatile herb that seamlessly integrates into dishes where traditional mint would be overpowering.
- **The Ultimate Pesto:** It creates a stunningly complex and refreshing pesto, either on its own or blended with basil. It pairs exceptionally well with peas, feta, and lamb, creating a more nuanced and sophisticated flavour profile.
- **Salads & Garnishes:** A game-changer in salads, grain bowls, and as a garnish for soups and roasted vegetables, providing a fresh, herbal lift without the dominant cooling sensation.
- **Modern Cocktails & Sauces:** Allows for the use of mint in delicate cocktails without overwhelming other ingredients. It also forms the base for innovative sauces for fish, poultry, and roasted carrots.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a vigorous but well-behaved perennial. Regular harvesting of the top leaves encourages bushy, compact growth. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous yield of 20–30g of large, aromatic leaves per week.**
