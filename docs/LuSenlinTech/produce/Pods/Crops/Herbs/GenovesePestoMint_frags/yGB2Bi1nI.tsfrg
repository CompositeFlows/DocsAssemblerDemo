This is a revolutionary cultivar that redefines the role of mint in the kitchen. Through targeted breeding, we have suppressed the dominant menthol production, unlocking a hidden world of complex, sweet, and herbal notes. The result is a mint with the bright, refreshing character of spearmint but with a surprising warmth and depth, making it the first mint truly designed for savoury sauces and fine dining.
