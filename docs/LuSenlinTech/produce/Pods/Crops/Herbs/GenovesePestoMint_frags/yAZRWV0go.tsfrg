##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a masterpiece of modern flavour chemistry and selective breeding:
- Traditional mint's dominant flavour comes from menthol, which activates the TRPM8 receptor in the mouth, creating the sensation of cold. By selectively breeding for plants with low menthol and high levels of other terpenes like limonene and caryophyllene, we created an herb that engages a wider, more complex palette of taste receptors.
- It was developed in direct response to chef requests for a mint that could be used in volume without "taking over" a dish, moving it from a garnish to a primary ingredient.
- Despite its low menthol content, it retains all the vigorous growth habits of mint, making it an incredibly productive and resilient plant for the urban gardener.

In short, **Genovese Pesto Mintâ„¢** is a **deconstructed and reimagined mint**, a sophisticated herb that opens up a new culinary dimension by removing the chill and revealing the hidden warmth and complexity within this ancient plant.
