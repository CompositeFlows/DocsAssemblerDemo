##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a piece of living culinary history, genetically stabilized for modern gardens:
- True French tarragon is sterile and does not produce viable seeds; all plants are clones descended from an original specimen. ‘Narrow-Leaf Nano’ is a selection from these clones, chosen for its compact internodal spacing and upright, tidy growth.
- The signature sweet-anise flavour comes from estragole (methyl chavicol), a phenylpropene that also gives basil its sweet notes. The peppery, bitter finish is attributed to other compounds like isoestragole, creating a complexity that the bland, bitter Russian tarragon (*Artemisia dracunculus var. inodora*) completely lacks.
- Its species name, *dracunculus*, means "little dragon" in Latin, a name it earned both for its coiled, serpent-like root system and its historical use in treating dragon (snake) bites, a testament to its long history in the herbalist's arsenal.

In short, **French Tarragon ‘Narrow-Leaf Nano’** is a **clonal fragment of French culinary DNA**, a precious and potent herb that delivers the uncompromising, authentic flavour required by classic cuisine, now tamed into a compact form for the discerning urban gardener.
