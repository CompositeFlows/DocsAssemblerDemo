This is the true, authentic French tarragon (*Artemisia dracunculus var. sativa*), the undisputed king of fines herbes, now perfected for compact cultivation. ‘Narrow-Leaf Nano’ delivers the complex, sweet-anise and slight peppery bitterness that is irreplaceable in classic French cuisine, all from a petite, well-behaved plant that faithfully replicates the flavour of its sprawling, temperamental parent.
