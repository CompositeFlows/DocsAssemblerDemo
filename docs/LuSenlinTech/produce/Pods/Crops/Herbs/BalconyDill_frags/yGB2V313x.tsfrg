##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a triumph of selective breeding over a plant's primal instincts:
- The "bolt-resistant" nature of ‘Frond-Flash’ is due to selective breeding for a longer juvenile phase. We've chosen plants with a genetic predisposition to delay the production of gibberellin, the plant hormone that triggers the switch from leaf production to flowering and stem elongation.
- The signature dill aroma comes from a compound called carvone (specifically the D-carvone isomer), which is also found in caraway seeds. This is different from the compound that gives tarragon (estragole) or anise (anethole) their licorice-like flavours, giving dill its unique character.
- Unlike its tall, lanky relatives that can reach over a meter, ‘Frond-Flash’ exhibits a dwarf habit due to shorter internodes (the spaces between leaves). This creates a bushier, more stable plant that is ideal for windy balcony conditions and maximizes leaf production in a small volume.

In short, **Balcony Dill ‘Frond-Flash’** is a **bolt-defying fountain of freshness**, a generous and resilient herb that solves the urban gardener's greatest dill dilemma, ensuring a long-lasting, plentiful supply of its bright, feathery fronds for all your culinary creations.
