This is a rapid-cycling, compact dill cultivar bred specifically to overcome the plant's natural tendency to bolt (flower) in confined spaces. ‘Frond-Flash’ focuses its energy on producing an abundance of feathery, fragrant fronds over a remarkably long period, delivering the bright, anise-citrus flavour of dill without the immediate rush to set seed that plagues standard varieties in pots.
