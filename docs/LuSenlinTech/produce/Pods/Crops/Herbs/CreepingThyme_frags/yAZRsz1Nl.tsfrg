##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a marvel of concentrated botany and historical symbolism:
- Its potent flavour comes from a high concentration of thymol, a powerful monoterpene phenol with documented antiseptic and antioxidant properties. Historically, thyme was associated with courage and was used to purify spaces; this antimicrobial action is the scientific basis for that tradition.
- The "creeping" (prostrate) habit is an adaptation for survival in harsh, windswept, and rocky environments, allowing it to stay low and conserve moisture. This same trait makes it perfectly suited for the shallow soil and exposed conditions of a balcony planter.
- Despite its miniature size, the surface area of its tiny, needle-like leaves relative to their volume is immense, creating a higher density of the glandular trichomes (tiny hair-like structures) that produce and store the aromatic essential oils.

In short, **Creeping Thyme ‘Tiny-Thymus’** is a **potent, prostrate flavour bomb**, a living testament to the idea that the most intense flavours often come in the smallest packages, offering a continuous harvest of classic, robust thyme essence from a beautiful, fragrant groundcover.
