##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a fusion of aesthetic appeal and culinary chemistry:
- The stunning purple colour is due to anthocyanins, the same powerful antioxidant pigments found in blueberries and blackberries. In the plant, these pigments act as a natural sunscreen, protecting the leaves from intense light stress.
- Its unique, less-bitter flavour profile is linked to a different balance of thujone and camphor—the compounds responsible for sage’s characteristic sharpness—alongside higher levels of fruity esters, a trait selected for during its development.
- Historically, sage (*Salvia*, from the Latin *salvare*, "to save") has been revered for its medicinal properties, particularly for memory and digestion. While ‘Plum-Sage’ is bred for cuisine, it retains the aromatic compounds that have linked this herb to wellness for centuries.

In short, **Compact Purple Sage ‘Plum-Sage’** is a **scented jewel of the herb garden**, a dual-purpose plant that provides a continuous harvest of uniquely flavoured, gorgeously coloured leaves to add a touch of visual drama and sophisticated flavour to your cooking.
