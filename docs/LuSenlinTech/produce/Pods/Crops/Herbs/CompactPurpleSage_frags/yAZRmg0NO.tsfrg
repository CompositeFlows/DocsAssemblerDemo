This is an ornamental and culinary double-feature, a dwarf sage cultivar prized for its stunning, dusky purple foliage and its exceptionally balanced, warm, and slightly fruity flavour. ‘Plum-Sage’ offers the earthy, camphorous notes of traditional sage but with less bitterness and a unique, complex undertone that makes it as beautiful on the plate as it is in the garden.
