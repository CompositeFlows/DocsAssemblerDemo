##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘Marj-Mini’ possesses a uniquely sweet, warm, and slightly spicy flavour with pronounced floral notes of camphor and balsam, and a distinct absence of oregano's characteristic bitterness. Its leaves are small, soft, oval, and a vibrant grey-green, growing on a dense, bushy plant that is exceptionally productive for its size.

###### 2. The Fragrant Finisher
This herb is best used at the end of cooking or raw to preserve its delicate, volatile oils.
- **The Secret to Sausages:** A classic, essential herb in many European sausage recipes, where its sweetness complements the rich, fatty meat without overpowering it.
- **Vegetables & Cream Sauces:** A transformative addition to sautéed mushrooms, roasted root vegetables, creamy pasta sauces, and vinaigrettes, adding a layer of sophisticated fragrance.
- **Herbal Butters & Oils:** Perfect for blending into compound butters for fish or steaks, or for steeping in olive oil to create a beautifully aromatic finishing oil for bread and salads.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant forms a tender perennial, bushy mound. Regular harvesting of the tip shoots encourages a denser, more productive form. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **surprisingly generous and continuous yield of 15–30g of tender, fragrant leaves per week.**
