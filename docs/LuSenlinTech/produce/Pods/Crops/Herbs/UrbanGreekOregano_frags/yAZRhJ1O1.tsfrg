##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘OG-35’ offers the true, authentic Greek oregano profile: a bold, peppery kick with complex notes of camphor, mint, and a pleasant, balancing bitterness. Its flavour is significantly more robust and less sweet than common Italian oregano. The plant is a compact, woody-stemmed perennial with small, fuzzy, grey-green leaves that are dense with essential oils.

###### 2. The Heart of Mediterranean Cooking
This oregano is a foundational dried herb, but its fresh form is a revelation.
- **The Pizza & Pasta Herb:** The undisputed champion for tomato-based sauces, pizza, and lasagna. Its bold flavour doesn't fade when baked, becoming more complex and aromatic.
- **Grilled Meats & Roasts:** The essential component in Greek marinades for lamb, chicken, and fish (especially the classic *Ladolemono*). Rubbed onto roasted vegetables or potatoes, it evokes the flavours of a sun-drenched taverna.
- **Legumes & Stews:** A key herb for seasoning lentil soups, bean stews, and braised dishes, where its earthy, peppery notes complement hearty ingredients.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a woody perennial that benefits from regular harvesting to prevent it from becoming leggy. Pinch or snip the stem tips just above a leaf node. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous yield of 10–20g of intensely aromatic fresh leaves per week. For the most potent flavour, harvest just before the plant flowers and dry the leaves.**
