##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar solves the most common frustration for coriander lovers:
- The "soapy" taste some people detect is linked to a specific gene that makes them sensitive to certain aldehydes in the leaves. ‘Metro-Pak Chee’ has been selectively bred from Thai landraces that naturally possess a different balance of aromatic compounds (higher linalool, lower aldehydes), resulting in a more universally pleasing, citrus-forward profile.
- Its dwarf, bushy habit and slow-bolting nature are the result of selecting for specific genetic markers that delay the plant's transition from leaf production to flowering, giving you a much longer window to enjoy the leaves.
- The name ‘Pak Chee’ is the Thai word for coriander, signalling its authentic culinary heritage and distinguishing it from the more mild-mannered coriander varieties typically found in Western supermarkets.

In short, **Dwarf Thai Coriander ‘Metro-Pak Chee’** is a **bolt-resistant flavour powerhouse**, a generous and reliable herb that finally makes it possible to have a continuous, authentic supply of this essential Southeast Asian ingredient at your fingertips.
