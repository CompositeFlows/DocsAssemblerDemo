##### The Science & Story Behind It

‘Lilypad-8’ is a living piece of history and a marvel of plant adaptation:
- The lotus effect (superhydrophobicity) is named after this plant. Its leaves are covered in microscopic, waxy bumps that make them perfectly self-cleaning; water beads up and rolls off, carrying dirt with it. This is the inspiration for advanced self-cleaning surface technologies.
- In Buddhism and Hinduism, the lotus is a powerful symbol of purity, beauty, and spiritual enlightenment, as it rises pristine from muddy waters.
- The characteristic crunchy texture of the stem is due to its complex, linked air canals (aerenchyma), a structural adaptation for aquatic life that we experience as a delightful culinary crunch.

In short, **Micro Lotus ‘Lilypad-8’** is a **living symbol of purity and crunch**, a plant that feeds both the body and the soul, offering a continuous harvest of exquisite, crisp stems alongside unparalleled natural beauty for your aquatic garden.
