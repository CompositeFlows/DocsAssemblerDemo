This is a dwarf, highly productive cultivar of the sacred lotus, a plant revered for millennia for its beauty, symbolism, and culinary versatility. ‘Lilypad-8’ condenses this grandeur into a compact form, offering a continuous harvest of both elegant, plate-sized pads and crisp, succulent stems, all from a single aquatic plant.
