##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
It offers a delicate, paper-thin leaf with a sublime balance of salty ocean brine and a distinct, sweet umami finish. When toasted, its flavour transforms, becoming robust, nutty, and intensely aromatic.

###### 2. The Essence of Umami
This algae is the cornerstone of many culinary traditions.
- **Sushi & Onigiri:** The essential wrapper for sushi rolls, hand rolls (temaki), and rice balls (onigiri).
- **Broths & Seasoning:** Torn into pieces, it is the base for delicate dashi broths, soups, and noodle dishes. It can be crumbled as a finishing salt-alternative over rice, salads, and roasted vegetables.
- **Modern Crisp:** Can be baked briefly with a touch of oil to create a light, gourmet seaweed crisp.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The algae grows as thin sheets on the Hydra-Padâ„¢. Harvest involves carefully cutting mature sections. A single pad provides a **yield of 3-5 large, pliable sheets every 3 weeks**, which can be used fresh, dried, or toasted for storage.
