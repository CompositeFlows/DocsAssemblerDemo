Our equipment is built around stackable, modular frames (1000mm × 500mm × 500mm, L × W × H) that form vertical towers for compact, scalable food production. Crafted from lightweight, self-healing nanomaterials for superior durability, each frame features plug-and-play slots for growing modules, such as hydroponic pods or aquaponic tanks, customisable to your cultivation goals. Select the number of frames for your tower to match your space and yield needs - start small and scale up effortlessly.
