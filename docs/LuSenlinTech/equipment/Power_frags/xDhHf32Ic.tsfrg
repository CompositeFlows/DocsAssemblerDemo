###### HotCarrier™:

Leveraging advanced hot carrier solar cell (HCSC) technology, HotCarrier™ Solar Panels capture high-energy sunlight (ultraviolet and visible light) that conventional panels lose as heat, achieving up to 85% energy conversion efficiency. Operating across a broad spectrum (300-2500 nm), these panels utilize quantum wells and graphene-based materials to minimize energy loss, delivering up to 850 watts per square meter under optimal sunlight. This exceptional performance ensures reliable charging for the SolisCell™ battery block.
