###### Key Features:

- **Scalable Stacking** - magnetic auto-locking connectors for easy vertical assembly; add or remove frames without tools.
- **Integrated Utilities** - magnetic Water/Power/Data Bus, one snap-in backbone distributes water + 48V DC + high-speed data through every level. Zero cable clutter; add or remove Frames without rewiring.
- **HydraRail™ Fluid Manifold** - micro-drip, fog, or flood modes selectable per Frame; self-sealing/healing NanoHealShield™ couplers prevent spills. Change crops or switch to aquaponics on the fly.
- **PureLight™** - transmits 95% of light of glass whilst providing superior insulation (~0.002–0.005 W/m·K). It is lightweight, durable, maximizes photosynthesis by maintaining stable temperatures for year-round crop growth.
- **PrecisionHeat™**  - Graphene Heat-Film, printed onto root chamber walls for ±0.3°C control.
- **NanoSunBeam™** Organic-phosphor LEDs auto-tune PAR, far-red & UV-A. Better flavour, longer shelf life, lower kWh.
- **HarvestSage™** - an on-board AI that automates all aspects of crop cultivation, from seeding to harvest. It uses real-time data for optimal growth and operates offline for reliability.
- **WindLock™ Shelves** - swap growing modules in < 10s. True plug-and-play.
- **WindLock™ Anchors** - tool-free, self-adjusting anchors that secure outdoor frame towers against high winds (up to 120 km/h).
