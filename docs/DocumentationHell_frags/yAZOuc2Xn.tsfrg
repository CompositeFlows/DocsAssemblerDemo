##### What are Decision Trees?

A decision tree is a classic tool for mapping choices - a flowchart that starts with a single "root" question and branches out into every possible outcome. For simple, binary choices ("Is the printer on?"), they provide a clear, logical path.

##### The Unspoken Reason They Fail

For decades, decision trees have been the obvious theoretical solution for capturing complex processes. Their failure in practice has is exponential complexity.

Adding just a few real-world variables - user roles, error states, environmental conditions - causes their branches to explode. Ten yes/no questions can generate over a thousand paths. For anything resembling real operational knowledge, they become monstrous, un-auditable, and utterly unmaintainable.

This isn't a minor inconvenience; it's the fundamental bottleneck that has prevented us from properly documenting complex, branching expertise. The ability to truly conquer this complexity would open up a powerful new way to build, maintain, and leverage knowledge in any field.
