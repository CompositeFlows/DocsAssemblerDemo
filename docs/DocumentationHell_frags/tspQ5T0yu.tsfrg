## This Website is *One* Guide

This website is not just talking about [Docs Assembler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=netoftrees.documentation-assembler) â€” it is a live demonstration of it. All the text you're reading has been dynamically assembled from a complex structure of interconnected maps. It demonstrates that you can create and maintain an expansive documentation system with a similar ease to how you maintain your codebase.

To see the mechanics: Look at this section 'This Website is One Guide' It is a single step in the opening map. Click the ancillary button at the end of that section: 'Show this step...' to see a screenshot of that exact step open in VS Code and drill into the features behind it. An ancillary is Docs Assembler's way of letting you expand information on-demand, without cluttering the main path for those who don't need it.

This is the proof. This is what treating docs like code looks like.
