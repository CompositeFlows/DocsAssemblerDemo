**Dive into the guide below.** As you configure a garden - selecting a frame size, modules, and crops - observe how [Docs Assembler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=netoftrees.documentation-assembler) manages the intricate decision logic. Each choice spawns a new branch, and with every selection, the potential paths grow exponentially. Without a **Single Source of Truth**, this complexity creates a mess. But with it, updates are effortless and instantly consistent.

In short, this demo isn't about gardens; it's a practical showcase of how [Docs Assembler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=netoftrees.documentation-assembler) masters the intricate decision-making inherent in any complex product, service, or operational procedure.
