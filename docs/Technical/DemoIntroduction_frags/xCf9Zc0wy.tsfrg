#### The Features You'll See

*   **Variables:** Manage product names ('SolisCellâ„¢'), shared text, and external URLs in one place. Change a variable's value, and it updates everywhere, ensuring absolute consistency.
*   **Shared Steps:** Reuse common instructions (like 'Fauna Categories') across multiple configuration paths, without duplication, enforcing a single source of truth.
*   **Nested Maps:** Create maps within maps, drilling down to any level of detail. This allows you to present a simple starting point that conceals virtually infinite complexity.
*   **Extracted Logic:** Isolate a complex branch (e.g., Tiny Patio or Balcony) into a separate, reusable component, keeping the main guide clean.
*   **Step-Variables:** Track user choices (e.g., `module = "Solo module"`) to generate custom output based on their selections.
*   **Auto-Adjusted URLs:** Ensure every link and image path remains valid, no matter how deeply nested or reused the content becomes.
