#### Why a Vertical Kitchen Garden?

We needed a product that was technically complex yet universally relatable. A robotics manual, while complex, isn't accessible to all. The Vertical Kitchen Garden is a tangible product that perfectly illustrates a classic documentation challenge: **sophisticated branching logic**.

**The** many permutations of a Vertical Kitchen Garden make it **an** ideal for demonstrating [Docs Assembler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=netoftrees.documentation-assembler) features that tame complexity:

*   **Variables:** Manage product names ('SolisCellâ„¢'), shared text, and URLs in one place. Change one variable, and it updates everywhere, ensuring absolute consistency.
*   **Shared Steps:** Reuse common instructions (like 'Fauna Categories') across multiple configuration paths, enforcing a single source of truth.
*   **Nested Maps:** Break down immense complexity into manageable, independent modules. Power options, crop choices, and frame assembly can each be self-contained maps, nested within the main guide.
*   **Extracted Logic:** Remove a complex branch (e.g., entire solar panel configuration) into a separate component. This hides complexity from the main flow while keeping it reusable and maintainable.
*   **Step-Variables:** Track user choices (e.g., `selected_module = "Solo"`) to enable dynamic, personalized guidance and generate custom output based on their selections.
*   **Auto-Adjusted URLs:** Ensure every link and image path remains perfectly valid, no matter how deeply nested the maps are or where they are reused.

In short, this demo isn't about gardens; it's a practical, relatable showcase of how [Docs Assembler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=netoftrees.documentation-assembler) handles the intricate decision-making inherent in every complex product, service, or operational procedure.
