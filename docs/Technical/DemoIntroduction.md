## Explore a Docs Assembler Solution

To demonstrate a system that captures complex thinking and simplifies intricate systems, we built an interactive product configurator for a fictitious innovator in modular food production: **Lǜ Sēnlín Technologies**.

We needed a demo that was technically complex yet universally relatable. A robotics manual/fault-lexicon, while highly complex, is impenetrable. A vertical kitchen garden is a fundamentally familiar product that illustrates how treating documentation like code transforms sophisticated branching logic from a maintenance nightmare into a structured, manageable asset.
