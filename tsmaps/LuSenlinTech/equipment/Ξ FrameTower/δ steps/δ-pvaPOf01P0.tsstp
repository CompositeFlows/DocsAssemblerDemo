Our equipment is built around stackable, modular frames (1000mm × 500mm × 500mm, L × W × H) that form vertical towers for compact, scalable food production. Crafted from lightweight, self-healing nanomaterials for superior durability, each frame features plug-and-play slots for growing modules, such as hydroponic pods or aquaponic tanks, customized to your cultivation goals. Choose from three tower configurations to suit your space and yield requirements - start small and scale up effortlessly.
