¬frameIntroduction:
Our equipment is built around stackable, modular frames (1000mm × 500mm × 500mm, L × W × H) that form vertical towers for compact, scalable food production. Crafted from lightweight, self-healing nanomaterials for superior durability, each frame features plug-and-play slots for growing modules, such as hydroponic pods or aquaponic tanks, customisable to your cultivation goals.¬


¬oneFrameIntroduction:
- ###### One Frame Tower - ideal for beginners or testing

   For 1-2 produce types (e.g., herbs or microgreens), yielding ~2-5kg/year. Height: 500mm.¬


¬twoFrameIntroduction:

- ###### Two Frame Tower - supports hybrid setups 
   e.g., vegetables and small fish like tilapia, yielding ~5-10kg/year. Height: 1000mm.¬


¬threeFrameIntroduction:
- ###### Three Frame Tower - the balanced performer
   Perfect for diversified harvests (e.g., leafy greens, strawberries, and herbs), yielding ~8-15kg/year. Height: 1500mm.¬


¬fourFrameIntroduction:
- ###### Four Frame Tower - maximizes yield in minimal space
   Enables full ecosystems (e.g., aquaponics with mushrooms, snails, and greens), yielding ~10-20kg/year. Height: 2000mm.¬
