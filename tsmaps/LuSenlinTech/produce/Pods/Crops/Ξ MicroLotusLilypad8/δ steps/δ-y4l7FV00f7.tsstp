##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
The young, rolled shoots (stems) are the primary edible, with a remarkably crisp, juicy texture similar to a water chestnut but more delicate, and a clean, mildly sweet, and nutty flavour. The mature leaves are not typically eaten but are stunningly decorative.

###### 2. A Dual-Purpose Aquatic Treasure
This plant provides both aesthetic beauty and unique culinary ingredients.
- **The Culinary Star - Stems:** The young, unopened stems are a prized vegetable in Asian cuisines. They can be sliced and added to stir-fries for a refreshing crunch, pickled for a tangy condiment, or eaten raw in salads.
- **The Decorative Canvas - Pads:** The perfectly round, blue-green pads are naturally water-repellent. They are used as stunning, natural serving platters for canapés, sushi, or desserts, imparting a subtle, fresh aroma.
- **Aromatic Wrap:** Fresh lotus leaves are traditionally used to wrap and steam sticky rice and meats, to which they impart a unique, fragrant, tea-like aroma.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant produces a continuous sequence of stems and pads from a central rhizome embedded in the Hydra-Pad™. Harvesting involves cutting young, firm stems (before the leaf unfurls) at the base. A single plant provides a **continuous yield of 3-5 harvestable stems per week, alongside a beautiful display of emerging pads.**
