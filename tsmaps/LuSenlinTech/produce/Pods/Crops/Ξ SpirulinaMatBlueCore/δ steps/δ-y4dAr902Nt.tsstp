###### 1. Flavour and Form
It has a distinctive, earthy, and mildly algal flavour, often described as a blend of green tea and spinach with an oceanic undertone. Its intense, vibrant blue-green colour makes it a natural food colourant.

###### 2. A Nutrient-Dense Supplement
Its power is best unleashed by incorporating it into other foods.
- **The Classic Smoothie:** A teaspoon of spirulina paste transforms any smoothie into a deep green, protein-packed health elixir.
- **Energy Boosting:** Mixed into salad dressings, energy balls, and homemade pasta or crackers for a hidden nutrient boost.
- **Visual Drama:** Used by avant-garde chefs to create naturally blue-toned sauces, ice creams, and lattes.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
It grows as a uniform, velvety mat on a dedicated bio-film cassette. Harvesting involves scraping the mature biomass from the surface. Each pre-colonised cassette provides a **yield of 80â€“120g of fresh spirulina paste over a 10-day harvesting window.**
