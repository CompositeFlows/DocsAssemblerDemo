This cultivar is a fully aquatic variant of traditional watercress, bred for a more concentrated peppery flavour and compact growth. It delivers the signature pungent kick of its terrestrial relative, but with a cleaner, sharper finish, all while thriving entirely submerged in a flowing aquatic environment.
