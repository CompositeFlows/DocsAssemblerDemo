###### The Science & Story Behind It

The genius of ‘Rocket-Flash’ lies in its optimized metabolic and hormonal pathways for speed and stability:
- Its rapid growth cycle is achieved by selecting for plants with a reduced juvenile phase, allowing them to transition from cotyledon to true leaf production faster than any other cultivar. This is combined with highly efficient nutrient uptake genes for accelerated biomass accumulation.
- The "Flash" in its name refers not just to speed, but to its stable flavour profile. The genes responsible for producing the pungent glucosinolates (glucoraphanin) are "always on," ensuring a consistently sharp flavour from the first true leaf, without the need for environmental stress to induce pepperyness.
- Its bolt resistance is hormonal; breeders selected for plants with a higher sensitivity to cytokinins (growth hormones) and a dampened response to flowering signals like heat and day length. This keeps the plant in a vegetative, leaf-producing state for longer, even on a hot, sunny balcony.

In short, **Arugula ‘Rocket-Flash’** is a **rapid-fire, pungent, and bolt-resistant** variety, a masterclass in speed and stability that guarantees a continuous, high-speed supply of intensely flavoured greens for the urban epicurean.
