###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Rocket-Flash’ offers an intense, classic arugula flavour: a bold, peppery kick with distinct nutty and slightly bitter undertones. The leaves are deep green, deeply lobed, and form a tight, low-growing rosette perfect for dense planting. Despite its speed of growth, the leaf texture remains impeccably tender, avoiding the toughness that can plague slower-growing, stressed plants.

**2. The Peak Pungent Punch**
This arugula’s robust flavour profile makes it a central ingredient, not just a garnish.
- **Standalone Star:** Its boldness stands up to rich ingredients. It is the foundation of a classic arugula salad with shaved Parmesan, lemon juice, and olive oil.
- **Pizza & Pastas:** A handful of fresh leaves tossed onto a hot pizza or mixed into pasta after cooking wilts slightly and releases its aromatic oils, elevating the entire dish.
- **Pesto with a Bite:** Creates a powerfully flavoured, peppery pesto that is a fantastic alternative to basil-based versions.
- **Gourmet Garnish:** Use to top bruschetta, soups, or grilled steaks to add a fresh, pungent counterpoint to rich, savoury flavours.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Rocket-Flash’ lives up to its "Flash" name. It is a rapid-cycle cut-and-come-again variety. Harvest by cutting individual leaves or shearing the entire plant about 3-4 cm from the base. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides an **exceptionally quick and abundant yield, with the first microgreen harvest in 10-12 days and full-sized leaves in 20-25 days, producing 25-45g of pungent leaves per week.**
