###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Silk-Butter’ lives up to its name, offering a remarkably delicate, sweet, and clean flavour with none of the bitterness found in some other lettuces. Its texture is its hallmark—incredibly soft, supple, and almost silky. The leaves are thin, flexible, and a vibrant, light green, forming a beautiful loose head.

**2. The Delicate Salad Base**
This lettuce is best used in applications where its delicate texture can shine without being overpowered.
- **The Classic Tender Salad:** The perfect base for delicate, lightly dressed salads where its texture is the star. It pairs exquisitely with soft herbs, edible flowers, and subtle vinaigrettes.
- **Gourmet Wraps & Cups:** Its large, pliable leaves are ideal for using as soft wraps for delicate fillings like chicken salad, quinoa, or roasted vegetables, serving as an edible, elegant container.
- **Luxury Garnish:** A perfect bed for showcasing beautifully plated seafood, terrines, or appetizers, adding a touch of refined colour and texture without competing in flavour.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
The plant forms a loose, open head. For the best quality, it is typically harvested as a full head by cutting at the base, but outer leaves can be picked for a extended, though less prolific, harvest. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **yield of one delicate, 120–150g head approximately 40 days from planting.**
