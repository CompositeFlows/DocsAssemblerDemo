##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘BlueFin’ offers the signature Lacinato kale profile: a deep, earthy, and slightly sweet flavour with peppery undertones, often described as more robust and complex than curly kale. Its leaves are long, narrow, and puckered with a stunning blue-green hue and a surprisingly tender, less fibrous texture than full-sized varieties.

###### 2. The Tender-Tough Supergreen
This kale's tender texture and complex flavour make it uniquely versatile.
- **Salad Raw & Massaged:** Young leaves are tender enough for raw salads. A quick massage with dressing breaks down the cell structure perfectly, eliminating toughness without wilting it into oblivion.
- **Soups & Sautés:** The classic choice for Italian *Ribollita* soup and quick sautés with garlic and chili. Its robust flavour holds up beautifully to cooking.
- **Kale Chips:** Its flat, structured leaves are ideal for making baked kale chips, yielding a crispy, savoury snack with an unparalleled depth of flavour.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant forms a compact, upright rosette. Harvest is a ‘cut-and-come-again’ process; carefully removing the lower, outer leaves encourages continuous production from the central crown. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous yield of 40–60g of tender, blue-green leaves per week for months.**
