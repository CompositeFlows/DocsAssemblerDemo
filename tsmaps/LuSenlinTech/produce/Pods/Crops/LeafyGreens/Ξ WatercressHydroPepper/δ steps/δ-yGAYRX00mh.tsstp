###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
‘Hydro-Pepper’ offers a bold, clean, and pungent flavour profile: an initial sharp, peppery kick reminiscent of radish, followed by a fresh, green, and slightly tangy finish. Its leaves are small, round, and dark green, growing on succulent, hollow stems that are exceptionally crisp and juicy. The entire plant forms a low, spreading mat of vibrant, glossy greenery.

**2. The Crisp, Peppery Accent**
This watercress’s intense flavour and refreshing crunch make it a powerful culinary accent.
- **Salad Spark:** A small handful will electrify a green salad, potato salad, or grain bowl with its pungent spice. It pairs brilliantly with sweet and rich ingredients like oranges, beets, and goat cheese.
- **Sandwich & Taco Topper:** The crisp stems and spicy leaves add a fantastic textural and flavourful crunch to sandwiches, burgers, and tacos, cutting through richness with its clean heat.
- **Signature Soups:** It is the essential, non-negotiable ingredient for a classic, creamy watercress soup, where its peppery flavour mellows into a deep, complex warmth.
- **Garnish with a Kick:** Use as a vibrant, edible garnish on soups, deviled eggs, or grilled fish to add a burst of fresh pepperiness.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Hydro-Pepper’ is a prolific cut-and-come-again variety. Harvest by snipping stems 3-5 cm above the base, using the "haircut" method. It will rapidly produce new shoots from the leaf nodes below the cut. Supplied as an RFID seed pad designed for a self-watering reservoir, it provides a **rapid and abundant yield of 40–60g of crisp stems and leaves per week, thriving in the consistently moist conditions it loves.**
