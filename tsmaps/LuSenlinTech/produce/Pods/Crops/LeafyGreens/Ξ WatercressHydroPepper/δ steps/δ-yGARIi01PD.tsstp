‘Hydro-Pepper’ is a revolutionary, self-watering cultivar that brings the vibrant, clean punch of wild watercress to the balcony garden. Traditionally an aquatic plant, this variety has been meticulously bred for superior performance in a standard self-watering container, eliminating the need for a running stream. It delivers the signature spicy, clean flavour and crisp texture of classic watercress, making its intense, peppery freshness accessible to every urban gardener.
