##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
‘Skyline Romaine’ offers the quintessential romaine profile: a sweet, nutty flavour with a supremely crisp and refreshing crunch. Its leaves are sturdy yet succulent, with prominent white midribs packed with water for exceptional juiciness. The plant forms a tight, self-wrapping column approximately 20-25 cm tall, resembling a miniature cos lettuce.

###### 2. The Ultimate Crisp Vessel
This lettuce’s structure and mild sweetness make it incredibly versatile.
- **The Perfect Caesar Vessel:** Its sturdy, cup-shaped leaves are the ideal size and strength for individual Caesar salad cups or as edible serving vessels for taco fillings and grain salads.
- **Grilled Lettuce:** Its compact, firm heart holds together perfectly when halved and grilled, developing a delicious smoky-sweet char while retaining a cool, crisp interior.
- **Sandwiches & Wraps:** Provides a superior crunch and structural integrity for wraps and sandwiches without the wateriness of softer lettuces.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a single-heading variety. For a continuous harvest, outer leaves can be picked, but the classic method is a full harvest by cutting the entire head at the base. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **yield of one dense, 180–220g head approximately 45 days from planting.**
