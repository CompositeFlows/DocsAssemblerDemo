##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a lesson in efficient plant architecture:
- The upright, columnar growth habit is known as an "erectophile" canopy, a trait selected to maximize light penetration to lower leaves in dense plantings. This is the same principle used in modern field crops to increase yield.
- Its exceptional crispness comes from a high internal turgor pressure and a specific composition of structural polysaccharides in its cell walls, allowing the leaves to snap cleanly rather than bend.
- Unlike its sprawling ancestors, ‘Skyline’ has been bred for a shortened, strengthened stem (core) and leaves that grow at a more acute angle, a genetic trait that prevents it from splaying out and wasting horizontal space in a confined balcony planter.

In short, **Skyline Romaine** is a **vertical column of crunch**, a space-efficient reimagining of a classic salad green that delivers the perfect structural integrity and refreshing sweetness for both raw and cooked applications, all from a minimalist footprint.
