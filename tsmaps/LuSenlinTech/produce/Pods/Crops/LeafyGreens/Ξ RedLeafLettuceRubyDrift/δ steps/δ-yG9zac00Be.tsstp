###### Culinary Profile & Uses

**1. Flavour and Form**
The flavour of ‘Ruby Drift’ is a classic, mild lettuce sweetness with a very clean, nutty finish and no trace of bitterness. Its leaves are incredibly soft and delicate, with deeply ruffled edges that range in colour from deep ruby-red at the tips to a bright, lime-green at the core and base. This creates a stunning, ombre effect in the garden and on the plate. The texture is exceptionally buttery and succulent.

**2. The Colour and Texture Specialist**
This lettuce’s primary culinary value lies in its unparalleled visual appeal and melt-in-your-mouth texture.
- **Salad Centerpiece:** Its dramatic colour and soft, frilly texture make it the star of any salad mix, adding visual depth and a delicate, sweet base that complements stronger flavours.
- **Gourmet Garnish:** The soft, ruffled leaves are perfect for elegantly plating dishes, adding a touch of colour and refinement to sandwiches, burgers, and appetizer platters.
- **Wraps and Cups:** While delicate, the larger, cupped leaves can be used as a tender wrap for fillings, providing a sweet and colourful alternative to tortillas or bread.
- **Texture Contrast:** Its buttery-soft texture provides a wonderful contrast to crisp ingredients like croutons, bacon bits, or fresh cucumbers.

**3. The Harvest and Yield**
‘Ruby Drift’ is a non-heading, cut-and-come-again variety designed for repeated harvesting. Gently snap off the outer leaves at the base, allowing the central growing point to continue producing new, brightly coloured leaves. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **consistent and beautiful yield of 30–50g of tender leaves per week, maintaining its colour and tenderness even as the plant matures.**
