###### The Science & Story Behind It

The development of ‘Fringe’ focused on refining leaf morphology and balancing flavour compounds:
- The "fringed" phenotype is the result of selecting for plants with a specific expression of genes controlling leaf margin dissection. This resulted in a more open, lacier leaf structure that maximizes light penetration to the lower leaves and increases the surface-area-to-volume ratio, which concentrates flavours and allows for faster growth.
- Its refined, less aggressive peppery taste comes from a carefully managed glucosinolate profile. While all mizuna contains these sulphur compounds (which give brassicas their bite), ‘Fringe’ has been bred for a lower concentration of the harsher glucosinolates and a higher level of those that provide a smoother, more complex mustardy note.
- Its remarkable tenderness is due to a reduction in lignin deposition in the leaf veins and petioles, ensuring every part of the frond is palatable and delicate, even as the plant matures.

In short, **Mizuna ‘Fringe’** is a **lacey, peppery, and perpetually productive** green, a masterclass in breeding for both aesthetic form and culinary function, delivering a continuous supply of elegant foliage to grace your plate.
