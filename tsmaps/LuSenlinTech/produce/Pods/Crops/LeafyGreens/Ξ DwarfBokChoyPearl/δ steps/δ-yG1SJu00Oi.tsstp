This is a miniature, self-wrapping marvel of a brassica, a bok choy cultivar bred for perfect, single-serving proportions. ‘Pearl’ delivers the classic sweet, mustard-cabbage flavour and satisfying dual texture of its full-sized relatives, with succulent white stems and tender dark green leaves, all contained in a beautiful, compact rosette.
