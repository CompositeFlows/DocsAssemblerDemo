This is not a single plant but a curated, self-balancing ecosystem of the world's smallest flowering plants, designed to be the most efficient protein source you can grow. This live mat of *Lemna* (duckweed) and *Wolffia* (watermeal) represents the frontier of sustainable urban nutrition, producing a complete protein with a smaller footprint than any terrestrial crop.
