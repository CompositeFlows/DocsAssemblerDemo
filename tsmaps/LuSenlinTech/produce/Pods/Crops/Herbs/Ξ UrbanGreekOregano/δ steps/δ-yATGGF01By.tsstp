##### The Science & Story Behind It

This cultivar is a piece of living culinary history, genetically stabilized for modern gardens:
- The "OG-35" designation signifies it is the 35th selection from an "Original Greek" landrace, chosen for its high concentration of carvacrol, the phenolic compound responsible for oregano's signature pungent, peppery, and slightly medicinal aroma. Its carvacrol content is over 5%, meeting the standard for the highest commercial grade.
- True Greek oregano is *Origanum vulgare* subsp. *hirtum*, often called "Winter Marjoram." This subspecies is genetically distinct from the milder, sweeter *Origanum majorana* (Sweet Marjoram) and other common oreganos, which are higher in the sweeter terpene thymol.
- Its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit is a direct genetic inheritance from its native habitat on rocky, arid hillsides. This makes it exceptionally resilient and low-maintenance in a container garden, requiring less water than many other herbs.

In short, **Urban Greek Oregano ‘OG-35’** is a **stabilized piece of the Mediterranean sun**, a genetically authentic herb that delivers the uncompromising, robust flavour demanded by serious cooks, bringing the untamed spirit of a Greek hillside directly to your urban balcony.
