##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
It offers the classic, robust basil profile: intensely sweet with notes of anise, clove, and pepper, but with a brighter, more concentrated top note. Its leaves are small, deeply green, and packed with aromatic oils, growing on a dense, bushy plant that rarely exceeds 25 cm in height.

###### 2. The Heart of Italian Cuisine
This basil is the irreplaceable soul of countless dishes.
- **The Perfect Pesto:** Its high oil concentration and balanced sweetness create the most authentic and vibrant pesto Genovese, requiring less basil by volume to achieve the same profound flavour.
- **Caprese & Salads:** The ideal size for whole leaves in a Caprese salad, on bruschetta, or as a fragrant garnish for pasta and pizza, providing a burst of fresh aroma.
- **Infusions & Desserts:** Steeped in cream for ice cream, muddled into cocktails, or infused into simple syrups, its sweet character shines in both sweet and savoury applications.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a "cut-and-come-again" variety. Regular harvesting of the top leaves, just above a node, encourages a bushier, more productive form. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous yield of 15â€“25g of pristine leaves per week from a single bay.**
