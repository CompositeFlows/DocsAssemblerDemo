##### Culinary Profile & Uses

###### 1. Flavour and Form
This duo delivers the signature Holy Basil (*Tulsi*) flavour: a warm, spicy, and peppery profile with pronounced notes of clove and a subtle, lingering minty freshness. The purple leaves often carry a slightly more robust, earthy undertone. The plant forms an beautiful, ornamental bush with vibrant green and deep violet leaves.

###### 2. Sacred Savor & Modern Mixology
While sacred in tradition, its uses are vibrantly modern.
- **Herbal Teas & Infusions:** The primary use. A few fresh leaves make a profoundly aromatic, caffeine-free tea, known in Ayurveda as "The Incomparable One" for its balancing properties.
- **Savory Stir-fries & Curries:** A key ingredient in Thai dishes like *Pad Krapow*, though its flavour is distinct from sweet basil. It adds a spicy, complex depth that stands up to intense heat and garlic.
- **Cocktails & Desserts:** Muddling a leaf of each colour creates an incredible aromatic base for gin or rum cocktails. It can be steeped in syrups or cream for unique, spiced desserts.

###### 3. The Harvest and Yield
The plant is a vigorous, branching perennial. Harvest the top sets of leaves regularly to maintain shape and encourage new growth, which will include both colour expressions. Supplied as an RFID seed pad, it provides a **continuous yield of 10â€“20g of mixed aromatic leaves per week.**
