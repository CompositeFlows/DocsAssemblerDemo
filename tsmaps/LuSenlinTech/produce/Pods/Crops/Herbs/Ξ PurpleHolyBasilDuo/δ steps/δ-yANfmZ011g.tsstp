This is a living tapestry of tradition and taste, a single cultivar that expresses itself in two stunningly different yet complementary forms. The Purple Holy Basil Duo pairs the classic green-leafed sacred basil with a dramatic, anthocyanin-rich purple variant, offering a complex, spicy-clove flavour revered for both its culinary and adaptogenic properties for over 3,000 years.
