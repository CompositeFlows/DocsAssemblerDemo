This is the gentle soul of the oregano family, a compact cultivar bred to deliver the soft, sweet, and complexly floral aroma of traditional sweet marjoram in a perfectly petite, prolific form. ‘Marj-Mini’ offers a more nuanced and delicate flavour than its robust cousin oregano, making it the secret weapon for dishes where fragrance and subtlety are paramount.
