#### Aeroponic Tuber Tower

This module is a space-efficient, multi-tiered system specifically engineered for a continuous harvest of gourmet, compact root vegetables. The TuberTower provides the deep, loose growing medium and precise conditions that **Finger Carrots, Baby Beets, Tokyo Turnips, and Baby Kohlrabi** need to develop perfect shape, colour, and flavour.
