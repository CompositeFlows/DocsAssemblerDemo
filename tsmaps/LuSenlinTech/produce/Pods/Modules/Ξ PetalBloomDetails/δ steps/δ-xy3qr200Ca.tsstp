##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- Laminar airflow is a principle borrowed from cleanroom technology, used here to create a micro-environment free from airborne contaminants and fungal spores that mar the appearance of delicate edible flowers.
- Electrostatic pollination is a non-invasive method that ensures genetic continuity without the physical damage caused by bees, brushes, or wind, which can bruise petals.
- The visual perfection of edible flowers is a key component of their market value and culinary appeal; this system treats appearance as a critical quality parameter, not just an afterthought.

In short, the PetalBloom is a **clean-air cultivation atelier** that uses atmospheric control and non-invasive technology to produce the most visually stunning and flavour-pure edible flowers and specialty greens, straight from your vertical garden to the plate.
