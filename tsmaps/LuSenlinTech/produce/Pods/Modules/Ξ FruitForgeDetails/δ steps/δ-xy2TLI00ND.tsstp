##### The Science Behind It

This process is made possible by contemporary research and technology:
- The relationship between root zone oxygen and fruit sugar content is well-documented; an oxygen-rich root environment is critical for the metabolic processes that create sugars and volatile flavour compounds.
- Light is not just energy for plants; specific wavelengths act as hormonal signals. The strategic use of far-red and UV-A light manipulates the plant's natural defences and reproductive strategies, channeling energy into fruit quality rather than just vegetative growth.
- By automating the most delicate tasks - pollination and harvest - the system protects the high-value yield it has worked so hard to produce.

In short, the FruitForge is a **flavour-optimization chamber** that uses root zone science and spectral programming to "forge" exceptionally sweet and aromatic fruits, delivering market-grade quality from a vertical garden setup.
