##### How It Works

###### 1. The Pre-Flowered Plug
{{el.luSenLinName}}’s nursery supplies robust, pre-grown plants that have already passed through their initial vegetative stage and are on the cusp of flowerintm. This selection - from the sprawling **Mini Cucumber ‘Rail-Runner’** to the compact **Patio Cherry Tomato ‘Sun-Dot’** - is ideal because these varieties have been bred for high fruit-to-plant ratios and will respond dramatically to the module's optimized conditions.

###### 2. Photosynthetic Forging in the Module
Once the plugs are seated in the FruitForge, {{tm.harvestSageTM}} initiates a rigorous fruiting program:
- The **{{tm.microBeadCapillarySubstrate}}** provides a perfect balance, wicking moisture to the roots while ensuring they remain in an oxygen-rich environment, preventing rot and encouraging massive root development to support heavy fruit loads.
- The **{{tm.nanoSunBeamTM}}** LEDs deliver intense, tailored spectra, boosting far-red to encourage flowering and UV-A to stress the plants just enough to dramatically increase sugar and antioxidant production in fruits like **City Chili ‘FireDot’** and **Alpine Strawberry ‘EverPink’**.
- The **{{tm.electrostaticPollenLift}}** ensures every flower is reliably pollinated within the enclosed environment, guaranteeing that each blossom has the potential to become a fruit.

###### 3. The Precision Harvest
The FruitForge signals peak ripeness with unparalleled accuracy.
- The **{{tm.aiFruitColourTracking}}** vision model continuously monitors the hue of each fruit, such as **Snack Pepper ‘Metro-Sweet’** and **Micro Eggplant ‘Metro-Sakura’**, and alerts you or triggers the **{{tm.magneticSnipBot}}** the moment 95% of the surface reaches the perfect colour.
- This robotic harvester gently snips the stem and deposits the ripe fruit into a sealed cup, ensuring flawless, unbruised produce.
- The system provides a **continuous yield, producing 1.5–2 kg of premium, sugar-dense fruit over a 10-week primary harvest period.**
