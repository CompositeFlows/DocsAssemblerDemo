#### Forest-Floor Fruiting Chamber

This module is a dark-cycle, climate-controlled system specifically engineered for all 15 strains of gourmet and functional fungi in our Balcony Edition catalogue. It replicates the precise environmental triggers of a natural forest floor to rapidly fruit a diverse array of mushrooms, from delicate enoki to robust lion's mane.
