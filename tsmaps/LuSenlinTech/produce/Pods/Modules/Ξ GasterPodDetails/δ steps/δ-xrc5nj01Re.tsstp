##### How It Works

###### 1. The Juvenile Stock
{{el.luSenLinName}}’s nursery supplies juvenile snails, carefully selected for health and genetic traits conducive to compact cultivation. This selection - from the classic **Table Snail ‘Helix Max-Mini’** to the striking **Burgundy Snail ‘Petit Bourguignon’** - is ideal because these terrestrial species thrive in the stable, humid microenvironment the GasterPod provides, exhibiting natural behaviours that are key to their development.

###### 2. Guided Cultivation in the Module
Once the snails are introduced to the GasterPod, {{tm.harvestSageTM}} initiates a specialized zootechnical program:
- The **{{tm.trackMazeHabitat}}** is a 90 mm spiral raceway that encourages natural movement and exercise, which is scientifically proven to yield thicker, stronger shells and higher meat-to-viscera ratios.
- The **{{tm.bioFilmDripFeedSystem}}** continuously coats feed leaves with a probiotic-rich film, providing a constant source of essential calcium for shell fortification while simultaneously suppressing pathogens in the humid environment.
- The system maintains a precise, humidity-stable atmosphere to prevent desiccation and support healthy mucous production, crucial for snail mobility and overall well-beintm.

###### 3. The Purified Harvest
The GasterPod ensures the highest standards of food safety and quality at harvest.
- The **{{tm.aiScheduled7DayPurging}}** algorithm initiates a controlled fast, timing it so the snails' digestive tracts are fully cleared exactly on your chosen harvest date, ensuring a clean, pure flavour.
- Harvesting is a simple process of collecting the mature snails from the accessible habitat.
- The system provides a **yield of 80–120g of prepared, purged snails per full production cycle.**
