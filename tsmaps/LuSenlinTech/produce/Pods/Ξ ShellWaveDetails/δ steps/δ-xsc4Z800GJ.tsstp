#### Pristine Bivalve Habitat

This module is a 15-litre recirculating aquaculture system specifically engineered for all 10 species of filter-feeding molluscs in our Balcony Edition catalogue. It maintains a sterile, oxygen-rich aquatic environment to support the delicate metabolism of bivalves, producing clean, sweet, and safe shellfish.
