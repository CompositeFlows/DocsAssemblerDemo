### Aromatic Hebs Catalogue - Tower Editions

Because culinary herbs are typically harvested in small, high-flavour portions, our Herb 500 Module is subdivided into 4 bays. Plant one herb across all bays for bulk harvests or mix up to 8 different herbs for a living spice rack.

All herbs are bred for:
- â‰¤ 25cm mature height.
- Fast regrowth after cutting.
- High essential-oil concentration for maximum aroma in small harvests.
