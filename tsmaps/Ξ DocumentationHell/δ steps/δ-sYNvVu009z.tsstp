- is an editor for building and managing complex documentation.
- is useful for adapting a core set of instructions to real-world scenarios without duplicating text.
- creates a single, authoritative system where your organisation's entire knowledge base is interconnected and always consistent.

It allows you to capture complex thinking and simplify intricate systems into a single source of truth. The result is a dynamic, auditable, and unified decision system that can guide an entire organisation, even through a crisis. It works by mapping out precise, authorised paths for resolving critical situations - all grounded in your organisation's verifiable knowledge. These paths can be used directly or referenced by AI Agents to improve customer support.

This entire website is a live example. The 'Vertical Kitchen Garden Planner' demo below shows the kind of detailed pathways you can build using DocsAssembler's text files.
