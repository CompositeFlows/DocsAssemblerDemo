# Tame Documentation Hell: Treat Your Docs Like Code

#### The Universal Problem: Trapped Expertise

Imagine you need to print a document from your laptop, but it doesn't work. The issue could lie with the laptop, the printer, or the Wi-Fi connection.

Without a technical expert on hand to guide you, it's nearly impossible to diagnose the fault and implement a fix. If you have some IT knowledge, you might try searching online. However, much of the advice you find is irrelevant to your specific situation, leaving you to experiment frustratingly for hours.

If you have no IT experience, you have no chance at all.

Now, scale this problem to an industrial level. Imagine a company that builds complicated medical machines. How do they capture an engineer’s diagnostic process to train others? Decision trees would be ideal, but for complex systems they explode into millions of unmanageable steps — 95% of them duplicates. Consequently, companies are forced to rely on ‘flat’ manuals which can’t record the complex, branching, decision-making process, which becomes a single point of failure for the entire organization.

The result is the same: organisations are fragile. They depend on a few experts, spend a fortune on training, and are one retirement away from a crisis. This is **documentation hell** — where critical knowledge is unrecorded, or scattered, and is impossibly difficult to use when it is needed most.
