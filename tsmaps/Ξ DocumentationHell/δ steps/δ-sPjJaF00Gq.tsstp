## How It Works: The Building Blocks

{{el.docsAssemblerExtension_link}} introduces key concepts that leverage this philosophy:

*   **Maps (.tsmap files):** These are the core building blocks — self-contained documentation modules (JSON files) that can be nested and composed, just like classes. Each Map can encapsulate anything from a simple procedure to an entire troubleshooting tutorial.
*   **Variables:** Define reusable text snippets for product names, common phrases, or URLs. Change the variable in one place, and that change propagates everywhere it’s referenced, eliminating an entire class of errors.
*   **Inheritance & Composition:** Build sophisticated guides from simple, reusable blocks. A change to a base “Map” automatically propagates to all guides that use it.
*   **Compile to Docs:** The system assembles these components on-the-fly into clean, standard Markdown (a process akin to compiling code), ready for GitHub Pages. The result? You **maintain a single source of truth for your documentation**, not a dozen fractured copies.
