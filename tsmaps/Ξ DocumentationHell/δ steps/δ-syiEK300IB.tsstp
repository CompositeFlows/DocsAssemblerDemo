¬import el from "../../shared/externalLinks"


#### This challenge manifests everywhere

But for developers, it’s a daily reality. It’s not just about writing docs — it’s about maintaining them. You’re likely all too familiar with the symptoms:

*   **Sprawling, duplicated content** that multiplies across guides, manuals, and wikis, making it impossible to know what’s accurate.
*   **Bug-prone updates:** You make a critical edit in one place, only to miss that same information duplicated in other files, instantly introducing inconsistencies.
*   **Brittle, unmanageable docs** that collapse under their own weight when you try to document complex, branching real-world scenarios.
*   **Wasting precious time** wrestling with static site generators and build scripts instead of writing code and building features.

What if you could solve this by applying the proven principles of software engineering directly to your documentation?

That’s the core idea behind {{el.docsAssemblerExtension_link}}, a VS Code extension designed to help you build documentation systems with **modular, reusable components**. Think of it as bringing **class-based inheritance** to your content. It allows you to create a system where your documentation is as maintainable and scalable as your codebase.
