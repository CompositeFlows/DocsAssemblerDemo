### This challenge manifests everywhere

It’s not just about writing docs — it’s about maintaining them. The symptoms are universal:

*   **Sprawling, duplicated content** - that multiplies across guides, manuals, and wikis, making it impossible to know what’s accurate.
*   **Bug-prone updates:** - you make a critical edit in one place, only to miss that same information duplicated in other files, instantly introducing inconsistencies.
*   **Brittle, unmanageable docs** - that collapse under their own weight when you try to document complex, branching real-world scenarios.
