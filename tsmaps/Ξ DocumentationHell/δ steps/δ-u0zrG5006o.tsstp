### The Cycle of Dread and Delay

It’s not just about writing documentation — it’s about maintaining it, a task that becomes a source of dread that teams actively avoid until an update is urgently needed. Why?"

*   **Duplicated content** - that multiplies across guides, manuals, and wikis, making it impossible to know what’s accurate or current.
*   **Error-prone updates** - you make a critical edit in one place, only to miss that same information duplicated in other files, instantly introducing inconsistencies.
*   **Unmanageable docs** – resulting from the struggle to document similar-but-diverging scenarios without creating redundancy and contradictions.
