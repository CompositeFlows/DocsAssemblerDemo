### Using Variables

Variables in {{el.docsAssemblerExtension_link}} allow you to define reusable pieces of text or markdown in one place and reference them throughout your documentation.

##### Defining a Variable

Variables are defined in special variable files, which use the *.tsvar* file extension. When the {{el.docsAssemblerExtension_link}} extension is installed, {{el.vscode_link}} will recognize these files and provide syntax highlighting and IntelliSense as if they were standard Markdown.

The syntax for defining a variable is straightforward. For a single line:

{{il.inlineVariableDefinition_image}}

e.g. 
{{il.garden_image}}

For a multi-line variable, such as a detailed note, you encapsulate the content:

{{il.multlineVariableDefinition_image}}

e.g. 
{{il.safetyNode_image}}

##### Using a Variable

To use a variable, you must first import the file it is defined in. You can assign any convenient alias to the file during import.

###### 1. Import the variable file
At the very top of your map or step file. 
Use the syntax:

{{il.importFileAlias_image}}

e.g.
{{il.importStatements_image}}

###### 2. Reference any variable
From the imported file wherever you want the content to appear, using the syntax:

{{il.fileAlias_image}}

e.g.
{{il.installationDiagram_image}}

During the publish process, {{el.docsAssemblerExtension_link}} will automatically replace every {% raw %}{<{file_alias.variable_name}>}{% endraw %} reference with the value defined in the variable file.
