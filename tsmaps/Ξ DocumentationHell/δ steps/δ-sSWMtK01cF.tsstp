### How This Page Was Built

The image below shows the step **"This Website is One Guide"** being edited within **Visual Studio Code** using the **Docs Assembler** extension.

{{il.thisWebsiteIsOneGuide_image}}

##### Here's a breakdown of the interface:  

*   **Left (File Explorer):** The *DocumentationHell.tsmap* file is selected, showing the guide's structure.
*   **Center (Map View):** The step "**This website is One Guide**" is selected in the Map Editor.
*   **Right (Markdown Editor):** The content of the step is open for editing.

### The Power of Variables:

This step contains an ancillary option, **"Show this step in the map"**. Selecting it reveals the following view in Docs Assembler:

{{il.showThisStepAncillary_image}}

Notice line 8. It doesn't contain a direct image link but a **variable**: 

{{il.thisWebsiteIsOneGuideVariable_image}}

On publish, this variable is automatically replaced with the actual markdown:

{{il.thisWebsiteIsOneGuideImageHtml_image}}
