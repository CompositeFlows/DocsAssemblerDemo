### See How This Page Was Built

This page isn't just text; it's a live demonstration assembled by Docs Assembler. The image below shows how the step "This Website is One Guide" is constructed in Visual Studio Code using the extension Docs Assembler.

{{il.thisWebsiteIsOneGuide_image}}{: .main-image}

###### What to notice:  

*   **Left (File Explorer):** The `DocumentationHell.tsmap` file is selected, showing the guide's structure.
*   **Center (Map View):** The step "**This website is One Guide**" is selected in the Map Editor.
*   **Right (Markdown Editor):** The content of that specific step is open for editing.

###### The Power of Variables:
  
Look at the image Markdown: **`{{il.thisWebsiteIsOneGuide_image}}`**

This isn't a hard-coded link. It's a **variable**. This means: 

1.  **One Source of Truth:** We chose to store all image URLs in a single, central file, then import at the top of any file tha needs to reference one of its variables:

    ```json
    import ll from "../../shared/imageLinks"
    ```

2.  **Easy Maintenance:** If an image's location changes, we update it in that one variable file. The change automatically propagates everywhere the variable is used, ensuring consistency, reducing errors, and saving hours of manual search-and-replace.
