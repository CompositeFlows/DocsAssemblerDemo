### Scaling Clarity, Not Complexity

The true power of this approach is that it scales.

Consider managing emergencies at an oil refinery. The variables are endless: fires, explosions, earthquakes, power loss, IT failures, medical crises. The number of internal teams - incident commanders, operators, maintenance, security, medical, PR, IT, legal, HR - is large, and each needs tailored, timely steps. External stakeholders like emergency services and media introduce more jurisdiction-specific requirements. Add in site variability like equipment locations and local laws, and the complexity is staggering.

Now imagine capturing all of that in a single, decentralised, maintainable system. Each team builds and maintains their own domain-specific body of knowledge, yet for the end-user, the experience is seamless and unified. The result is a single source of truth - validated, up-to-date, and turning collective knowledge into decisive action when it's needed most.
