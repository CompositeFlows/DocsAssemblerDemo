### Scaling Clarity, Not Complexity

The true power of this approach is that it scales. 

Consider managing emergencies at an oil refinery. The variables are endless: fires, explosions, earthquakes, power loss, IT failures, medical crises. The number of internal teams — incident commanders, operators, maintenance, security, medical, PR, IT, legal, HR — is large, and each needs tailored, timely steps. External stakeholders like emergency services and media introduce more jurisdiction-specific requirements. Add in site variability like equipment locations and local laws, and the complexity is staggering.

Now imagine capturing all of that in a single, maintainable system. Each team builds and maintains their own domain-specific maps. The result is a unified, validated, and up-to-date source of truth capable of guiding an entire organisation through a crisis.
