¬import il from "../../shared/imageLinks"
¬import el from "../../shared/externalLinks"
¬import euh from "../_shared/ExploreUnderTheHood"


#### The Power of Variables:

The step **"{{euh.exploreUnderTheHood}}"** has an ancillary option **"Show this step..."**. Selecting it reveals the following view in {{el.docsAssemblerExtension_link}}:

{{il.showThisStepAncillary_image}}

Notice line 14.  
It is a **variable**: 

{{il.howItWorksVariable_image}}

On publish, a variable is automatically replaced with the variable's value.  
In this case it is markdown for an image link:

{{il.howItWorksImageHtml_image}}

##### This approach provides two key advantages:

1.  **One Source of Truth:** By storing all image URLs in a single, central variables file. To place an image in a step file, we simply reference the variable where the image should appear.
2.  **Easy Maintenance:** Changing an image requires just one update in the variables file. That change automatically propagates everywhere the variable is used, ensuring consistency, reducing errors, and saving hours of manual work.
