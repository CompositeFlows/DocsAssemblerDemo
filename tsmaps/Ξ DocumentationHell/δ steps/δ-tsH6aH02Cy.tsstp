##### This approach provides two key advantages:

1.  **One Source of Truth:** Here we chose to store all image URLs in a single, central variables file. To place an image in a step file, we simply reference the variable where the image should appear.
2.  **Easy Maintenance:** Changing an image requires just one update in the variables file. That change automatically propagates everywhere the variable is used, ensuring consistency, reducing errors, and saving hours of manual work.
