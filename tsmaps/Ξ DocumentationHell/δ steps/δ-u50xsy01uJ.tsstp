This structured knowledge base is also the perfect foundation for the future. On top of it, you could have a guide front-end (as shown in the HAL example) or a powerful **conversational interface powered by a Graph-Augmented LLM** — an AI that can answer complex questions and generate precise guidance because it’s grounded in your company’s Graph-Based Knowledge, not just general information. This grounding in a verifiable source of truth is the most effective method to dramatically reduce the hallucinations that can plague even advanced LLMs.

This is the destination: turning trapped expertise into a structured, actionable authoritative, frame-of-reference for complex operations.
