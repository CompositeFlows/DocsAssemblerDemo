¬managingEmergencies:
Consider managing emergencies at an oil refinery. The variables are endless: fires, explosions, earthquakes, power loss, IT failures, medical crises. The number of internal teams — incident commanders, operators, maintenance, security, medical, PR, IT, legal, HR — is large, and each needs tailored, timely steps. External stakeholders like emergency services and media introduce more jurisdiction-specific requirements. Add in site variability like equipment locations and local laws, and the complexity is staggering.¬

¬teamSpecific:
Now imagine capturing all of that in a single, maintainable system. Each team builds and maintains their own domain-specific maps. The result is a unified, validated, and always up-to-date source of truth that can guide an entire organisation through a crisis.¬

¬structuredKnowledgeBase:
This structured knowledge base is also the perfect foundation for the future. On top of it, you could have a guide front-end or a powerful **conversational interface powered by a Graph-Augmented LLM** — an AI that can answer complex questions and generate precise guidance because it’s grounded in your company’s verifiable knowledge, not just general information. This grounding is the most effective method to dramatically reduce the AI hallucinations that can plague even advanced systems.¬
