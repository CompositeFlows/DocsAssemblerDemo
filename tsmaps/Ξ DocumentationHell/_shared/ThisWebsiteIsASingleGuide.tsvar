¬thisWebsiteTitle: This Website is *A* Single Guide

¬functioningExample: 
This website is not just talking about {{el.docsAssemblerExtension_link}} — it is a live, functioning example of it. Every piece of text you see has been dynamically assembled from a structure of interconnected maps. This demonstrates how you can create and maintain an expansive documentation system with the same ease and precision as you maintain your codebase.¬

¬thisIsTheProof: This is the proof. This is what treating docs like code looks like.
